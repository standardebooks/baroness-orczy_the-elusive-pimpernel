    <h2>
      Chapter I: Paris: 1793
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was not even a reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On! ever on! in that wild, surging torrent; sowing the wind of anarchy, of
      terrorism, of lust of blood and hate, and reaping a hurricane of
      destruction and of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      On! ever on! France, with Paris and all her children still rushes blindly,
      madly on; defies the powerful coalition,—Austria, England, Spain,
      Prussia, all joined together to stem the flow of carnage,—defies the
      Universe and defies God!
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris this September 1793!—or shall we call it Vendemiaire, Year I.
      of the Republic?—call it what we will! Paris! a city of bloodshed,
      of humanity in its lowest, most degraded aspect. France herself a gigantic
      self-devouring monster, her fairest cities destroyed, Lyons razed to the
      ground, Toulon, Marseilles, masses of blackened ruins, her bravest sons
      turned to lustful brutes or to abject cowards seeking safety at the cost
      of any humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is thy reward, oh mighty, holy Revolution! apotheosis of equality and
      fraternity! grand rival of decadent Christianity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five weeks now since Marat, the bloodthirsty Friend of the People,
      succumbed beneath the sheath-knife of a virgin patriot, a month since his
      murderess walked proudly, even enthusiastically, to the guillotine! There
      has been no reaction—only a great sigh!... Not of content or
      satisfied lust, but a sigh such as the man-eating tiger might heave after
      his first taste of long-coveted blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sigh for more!
    </p>
    <p>
      A king on the scaffold; a queen degraded and abased, awaiting death, which
      lingers on the threshold of her infamous prison; eight hundred scions of
      ancient houses that have made the history of France; brave generals,
      Custine, Blanchelande, Houchard, Beauharnais; worthy patriots,
      noble-hearted women, misguided enthusiasts, all by the score and by the
      hundred, up the few wooden steps which lead to the guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      An achievement of truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      And still that sigh for more!
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the moment,—a few seconds only,—Paris looked round her
      mighty self, and thought things over!
    </p>
    <p>
      The man-eating tiger for the space of a sigh licked his powerful jaws and
      pondered!
    </p>
    <p>
      Something new!—something wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
      We have had a new Constitution, a new Justice, new Laws, a new Almanack!
    </p>
    <p>
      What next?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, obviously!—How comes it that great, intellectual, aesthetic
      Paris never thought of such a wonderful thing before?
    </p>
    <p>
      A new religion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Christianity is old and obsolete, priests are aristocrats, wealthy
      oppressors of the People, the Church but another form of wanton tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us by all means have a new religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already something has been done to destroy the old! To destroy! always to
      destroy! Churches have been ransacked, altars spoliated, tombs desecrated,
      priests and curates murdered; but that is not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must be a new religion; and to attain that there must be a new God.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Man is a born idol-worshipper.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Very well then! let the People have a new religion and a new God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay!—Not a God this time!—for God means Majesty, Power,
      Kingship! everything in fact which the mighty hand of the people of France
      has struggled and fought to destroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a God, but a goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      A goddess! an idol! a toy! since even the man-eating tiger must play
      sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paris wanted a new religion, and a new toy, and grave men, ardent
      patriots, mad enthusiasts, sat in the Assembly of the Convention and
      seriously discussed the means of providing her with both these things
      which she asked for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaumette, I think it was, who first solved the difficulty:—Procureur
      Chaumette, head of the Paris Municipality, he who had ordered that the
      cart which bore the dethroned queen to the squalid prison of the
      Conciergerie should be led slowly past her own late palace of the
      Tuileries, and should be stopped there just long enough for her to see and
      to feel in one grand mental vision all that she had been when she dwelt
      there, and all that she now was by the will of the People.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaumette, as you see, was refined, artistic;—the torture of the
      fallen Queen's heart meant more to him than a blow of the guillotine on
      her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, therefore, that it was Procureur Chaumette who first discovered
      exactly what type of new religion Paris wanted just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us have a Goddess of Reason,” he said, “typified if you will by the
      most beautiful woman in Paris. Let us have a feast of the Goddess of
      Reason, let there be a pyre of all the gew-gaws which for centuries have
      been flaunted by overbearing priests before the eyes of starving
      multitudes, let the People rejoice and dance around that funeral pile, and
      above it all let the new Goddess tower smiling and triumphant. The Goddess
      of Reason! the only deity our new and regenerate France shall acknowledge
      throughout the centuries which are to come!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Loud applause greeted the impassioned speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A new goddess, by all means!” shouted the grave gentlemen of the National
      Assembly, “the Goddess of Reason!”
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all eager that the People should have this toy; something to
      play with and to tease, round which to dance the mad Carmagnole and sing
      the ever-recurring “Ca ira.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Something to distract the minds of the populace from the consequences of
      its own deeds, and the helplessness of its legislators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Procureur Chaumette enlarged upon his original idea; like a true artist
      who sees the broad effect of a picture at a glance and then fills in the
      minute details, he was already busy elaborating his scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The goddess must be beautiful... not too young... Reason can only go hand
      in hand with the riper age of second youth... she must be decked out in
      classical draperies, severe yet suggestive... she must be rouged and
      painted... for she is a mere idol... easily to be appeased with incense,
      music and laughter.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He was getting deeply interested in his subject, seeking minutiae of
      detail, with which to render his theme more and more attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But patience was never the characteristic of the Revolutionary Government
      of France. The National Assembly soon tired of Chaumette's dithyrambic
      utterances. Up aloft on the Mountain, Danton was yawning like a gigantic
      leopard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Henriot was on his feet. He had a far finer scheme than that of the
      Procureur to place before his colleagues. A grand National fete,
      semi-religious in character, but of the new religion which destroyed and
      desecrated and never knelt in worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizen Chaumette's Goddess of Reason by all means—Henriot conceded
      that the idea was a good one—but the goddess merely as a
      figure-head: around her a procession of unfrocked and apostate priests,
      typifying the destruction of ancient hierarchy, mules carrying loads of
      sacred vessels, the spoils of ten thousand churches of France, and ballet
      girls in bacchanalian robes, dancing the Carmagnole around the new deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public Prosecutor Foucquier Tinville thought all these schemes very tame.
      Why should the People of France be led to think that the era of a new
      religion would mean an era of milk and water, of pageants and of
      fireworks? Let every man, woman, and child know that this was an era of
      blood and again of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” he exclaimed in passionate accents, “would that all the traitors in
      France had but one head, that it might be cut off with one blow of the
      guillotine!”
     </p>
    <p>
      He approved of the National fete, but he desired an apotheosis of the
      guillotine; he undertook to find ten thousand traitors to be beheaded on
      one grand and glorious day: ten thousand heads to adorn the Place de la
      Revolution on a great, never-to-be-forgotten evening, after the guillotine
      had accomplished this record work.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Collot d'Herbois would also have his say. Collot lately hailed from
      the South, with a reputation for ferocity unparalleled throughout the
      whole of this horrible decade. He would not be outdone by Tinville's
      bloodthirsty schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the inventor of the “Noyades,” which had been so successful at
      Lyons and Marseilles. “Why not give the inhabitants of Paris one of these
      exhilarating spectacles?” he asked with a coarse, brutal laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he explained his invention, of which he was inordinately proud. Some
      two or three hundred traitors, men, women, and children, tied securely
      together with ropes in great, human bundles and thrown upon a barge in the
      middle of the river: the barge with a hole in her bottom! not too large!
      only sufficient to cause her to sink slowly, very slowly, in sight of the
      crowd of delighted spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cries of the women and children, and even of the men, as they felt the
      waters rising and gradually enveloping them, as they felt themselves
      powerless even for a fruitless struggle, had proved most exhilarating, so
      Citizen Collot declared, to the hearts of the true patriots of Lyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the discussion continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the era when every man had but one desire, that of outdoing
      others in ferocity and brutality, and but one care, that of saving his own
      head by threatening that of his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great duel between the Titanic leaders of these turbulent parties, the
      conflict between hot-headed Danton on the one side and cold-blooded
      Robespierre on the other, had only just begun; the great, all-devouring
      monsters had dug their claws into one another, but the issue of the combat
      was still at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of these two giants had taken part in these deliberations anent
      the new religion and the new goddess. Danton gave signs now and then of
      the greatest impatience, and muttered something about a new form of
      tyranny, a new kind of oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left, Robespierre in immaculate sea-green coat and carefully
      gauffered linen was quietly polishing the nails of his right hand against
      the palm of his left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing escaped him of what was going on. His ferocious egoism, his
      unbounded ambition was even now calculating what advantages to himself
      might accrue from this idea of the new religion and of the National fete,
      what personal aggrandisement he could derive therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter outwardly seemed trivial enough, but already his keen and
      calculating mind had seen various side issues which might tend to place
      him—Robespierre—on a yet higher and more unassailable
      pinnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surrounded by those who hated him, those who envied and those who feared
      him, he ruled over them all by the strength of his own cold-blooded
      savagery, by the resistless power of his merciless cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cared about nobody but himself, about nothing but his own exaltation:
      every action of his career, since he gave up his small practice in a quiet
      provincial town in order to throw himself into the wild vortex of
      revolutionary politics, every word he ever uttered had but one aim—Himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his colleagues and comrades of the old Jacobin Clubs ruthlessly
      destroyed around him: friends he had none, and all left him indifferent;
      and now he had hundreds of enemies in every assembly and club in Paris,
      and these too one by one were being swept up in that wild whirlpool which
      they themselves had created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impassive, serene, always ready with a calm answer, when passion raged
      most hotly around him, Robespierre, the most ambitious, most self-seeking
      demagogue of his time, had acquired the reputation of being incorruptible
      and selfless, an enthusiastic servant of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea-green Incorruptible!
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus whilst others talked and argued, waxed hot over schemes for
      processions and pageantry, or loudly denounced the whole matter as the
      work of a traitor, he, of the sea-green coat, sat quietly polishing his
      nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had already weighed all these discussions in the balance of his
      mind, placed them in the crucible of his ambition, and turned them into
      something that would benefit him and strengthen his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye! the feast should be brilliant enough! gay or horrible, mad or
      fearful, but through it all the people of France must be made to feel that
      there was a guiding hand which ruled the destinies of all, a head which
      framed the new laws, which consolidated the new religion and established
      its new goddess: the Goddess of Reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre, her prophet!
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter II: A Retrospect
    </h2>
    <p>
      The room was close and dark, filled with the smoke from a defective
      chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tiny boudoir, once the dainty sanctum of imperious Marie Antoinette; a
      faint and ghostly odour, like unto the perfume of spectres, seemed still
      to cling to the stained walls, and to the torn Gobelin tapestries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere lay the impress of a heavy and destroying hand: that of the
      great and glorious Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mud-soiled corners of the room a few chairs, with brocaded cushions
      rudely torn, leant broken and desolate against the walls. A small
      footstool, once gilt-legged and satin-covered, had been overturned and
      roughly kicked to one side, and there it lay on its back, like some little
      animal that had been hurt, stretching its broken limbs upwards, pathetic
      to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the delicately wrought Buhl table the silver inlay had been harshly
      stripped out of its bed of shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the Lunette, painted by Boucher and representing a chaste Diana
      surrounded by a bevy of nymphs, an uncouth hand had scribbled in charcoal
      the device of the Revolution: Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite ou la Mort;
      whilst, as if to give a crowning point to the work of destruction and to
      emphasise its motto, someone had decorated the portrait of Marie
      Antoinette with a scarlet cap, and drawn a red and ominous line across her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the table two men were sitting in close and eager conclave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them a solitary tallow candle, unsnuffed and weirdly flickering,
      threw fantastic shadows upon the walls, and illumined with fitful and
      uncertain light the faces of the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different were these in character!
    </p>
    <p>
      One, high cheek-boned, with coarse, sensuous lips, and hair elaborately
      and carefully powdered; the other pale and thin-lipped, with the keen eyes
      of a ferret and a high intellectual forehead, from which the sleek brown
      hair was smoothly brushed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these men was Robespierre, the ruthless and incorruptible
      demagogue; the other was Citizen Chauvelin, ex-ambassador of the
      Revolutionary Government at the English Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour was late, and the noises from the great, seething city preparing
      for sleep came to this remote little apartment in the now deserted Palace
      of the Tuileries, merely as a faint and distant echo.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two days after the Fructidor Riots. Paul Deroulede and the woman
      Juliette Marny, both condemned to death, had been literally spirited away
      out of the cart which was conveying them from the Hall of Justice to the
      Luxembourg Prison, and news had just been received by the Committee of
      Public Safety that at Lyons, the Abbe du Mesnil, with the ci-devant
      Chevalier d'Egremont and the latter's wife and family, had effected a
      miraculous and wholly incomprehensible escape from the Northern Prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not all. When Arras fell into the hands of the Revolutionary
      army, and a regular cordon was formed round the town, so that not a single
      royalist traitor might escape, some three score women and children, twelve
      priests, the old aristocrats Chermeuil, Delleville and Galipaux and many
      others, managed to pass the barriers and were never recaptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raids were made on the suspected houses: in Paris chiefly where the
      escaped prisoners might have found refuge, or better still where their
      helpers and rescuers might still be lurking. Foucquier Tinville, Public
      Prosecutor, led and conducted these raids, assisted by that bloodthirsty
      vampire, Merlin. They heard of a house in the Rue de l'Ancienne Comedie
      where an Englishmen was said to have lodged for two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      They demanded admittance, and were taken to the rooms where the Englishman
      had stayed. These were bare and squalid, like hundreds of other rooms in
      the poorer quarters of Paris. The landlady, toothless and grimy, had not
      yet tidied up the one where the Englishman had slept: in fact she did not
      know he had left for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had paid for his room, a week in advance, and came and went as he
      liked, she explained to Citizen Tinville. She never bothered about him, as
      he never took a meal in the house, and he was only there two days. She did
      not know her lodger was English until the day he left. She thought he was
      a Frenchman from the South, as he certainly had a peculiar accent when he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was the day of the riots,” she continued; “he would go out, and I told
      him I did not think that the streets would be safe for a foreigner like
      him: for he always wore such very fine clothes, and I made sure that the
      starving men and women of Paris would strip them off his back when their
      tempers were roused. But he only laughed. He gave me a bit of paper and
      told me that if he did not return I might conclude that he had been
      killed, and if the Committee of Public Safety asked me questions about me,
      I was just to show the bit of paper and there would be no further
      trouble.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She had talked volubly, more than a little terrified at Merlin's scowls,
      and the attitude of Citizen Tinville, who was known to be very severe if
      anyone committed any blunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Citizeness—her name was Brogard and her husband's brother
      kept an inn in the neighbourhood of Calais—the Citizeness Brogard
      had a clear conscience. She held a license from the Committee of Public
      Safety for letting apartments, and she had always given due notice to the
      Committee of the arrival and departure of her lodgers. The only thing was
      that if any lodger paid her more than ordinarily well for the
      accommodation and he so desired it, she would send in the notice
      conveniently late, and conveniently vaguely worded as to the description,
      status and nationality of her more liberal patrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had occurred in the case of her recent English visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not explain it quite like that to Citizen Foucquier Tinville
      or to Citizen Merlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she was rather frightened, and produced the scrap of paper which
      the Englishman had left with her, together with the assurance that when
      she showed it there would be no further trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinville took it roughly out of her hand, but would not glance at it. He
      crushed it into a ball and then Merlin snatched it from him with a coarse
      laugh, smoothed out the creases on his knee and studied it for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two lines of what looked like poetry, written in a language
      which Merlin did not understand. English, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was perfectly clear, and easily comprehended by any one, was the
      little drawing in the corner, done in red ink and representing a small
      star-shaped flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tinville and Merlin both cursed loudly and volubly, and bidding their
      men follow them, turned away from the house in the Rue de l'Ancienne
      Comedie and left its toothless landlady on her own doorstep still volubly
      protesting her patriotism and her desire to serve the government of the
      Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinville and Merlin, however, took the scrap of paper to Citizen
      Robespierre, who smiled grimly as he in his turn crushed the offensive
      little document in the palm of his well-washed hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre did not swear. He never wasted either words or oaths, but he
      slipped the bit of paper inside the double lid of his silver snuff box and
      then he sent a special messenger to Citizen Chauvelin in the Rue
      Corneille, bidding him come that same evening after ten o'clock to room
      No. 16 in the ci-devant Palace of the Tuileries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now half-past ten, and Chauvelin and Robespierre sat opposite one
      another in the ex-boudoir of Queen Marie Antoinette, and between them on
      the table, just below the tallow-candle, was a much creased, exceedingly
      grimy bit of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had passed through several unclean hands before Citizen Robespierre's
      immaculately white fingers had smoothed it out and placed it before the
      eyes of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, however, was not looking at the paper, he was not even looking
      at the pale, cruel face before him. He had closed his eyes and for a
      moment had lost sight of the small dark room, of Robespierre's ruthless
      gaze, of the mud-stained walls and greasy floor. He was seeing, as in a
      bright and sudden vision, the brilliantly-lighted salons of the Foreign
      Office in London, with beautiful Marguerite Blakeney gliding queenlike on
      the arm of the Prince of Wales.

    <p>
      He heard the flutter of many fans, the frou-frou of silk dresses, and
      above all the din and sound of dance music, he heard an inane laugh and an
      affected voice repeating the doggerel rhyme that was even now written on
      that dirty piece of paper which Robespierre had placed before him:
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          “We seek him here, and we seek him there,<br /> Those Frenchies seek
          him everywhere!<br /> Is he in heaven, is he in hell,<br /> That demmed
          elusive Pimpernel?”
         </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      It was a mere flash! One of memory's swiftly effaced pictures, when she
      shows us for the fraction of a second, indelible pictures from out our
      past. Chauvelin, in that same second, while his own eyes were closed and
      Robespierre's fixed upon him, also saw the lonely cliffs of Calais, heard
      the same voice singing: “God save the King!” the volley of musketry, the
      despairing cries of Marguerite Blakeney; and once again he felt the keen
      and bitter pang of complete humiliation and defeat.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter III: Ex-Ambassador Chauvelin
    </h2>
    <p>
      Robespierre had quietly waited the while. He was in no hurry: being a
      night-bird of very pronounced tastes, he was quite ready to sit here until
      the small hours of the morning watching Citizen Chauvelin mentally
      writhing in the throes of recollections of the past few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing that delighted the sea-green Incorruptible quite so much
      as the aspect of a man struggling with a hopeless situation and feeling a
      net of intrigue drawing gradually tighter and tighter around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now, when he saw Chauvelin's smooth forehead wrinkled into an anxious
      frown, and his thin hand nervously clutched upon the table, Robespierre
      heaved a pleasurable sigh, leaned back in his chair, and said with an
      amiable smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You do agree with me, then, Citizen, that the situation has become
      intolerable?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as Chauvelin did not reply, he continued, speaking more sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how terribly galling it all is, when we could have had that man under
      the guillotine by now, if you had not blundered so terribly last year.”
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had become hard and trenchant like that knife to which he was so
      ready to make constant allusion. But Chauvelin still remained silent.
      There was really nothing that he could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Citizen Chauvelin, how you must hate that man!” exclaimed Robespierre at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then only did Chauvelin break the silence which up to now he had appeared
      to have forced himself to keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do!” he said with unmistakable fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then why do you not make an effort to retrieve the blunders of last
      year?” queried Robespierre blandly. “The Republic has been unusually
      patient and long-suffering with you, Citizen Chauvelin. She has taken your
      many services and well-known patriotism into consideration. But you know,”
       he added significantly, “that she has no use for worthless tools.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as Chauvelin seemed to have relapsed into sullen silence, he
      continued with his original ill-omened blandness:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ma foi! Citizen Chauvelin, were I standing in your buckled shoes, I would
      not lose another hour in trying to avenge mine own humiliation!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Have I ever had a chance?” burst out Chauvelin with ill-suppressed
      vehemence. “What can I do single-handed? Since war has been declared I
      cannot go to England unless the Government will find some official reason
      for my doing so. There is much grumbling and wrath over here, and when
      that damned Scarlet Pimpernel League has been at work, when a score or so
      of valuable prizes have been snatched from under the very knife of the
      guillotine, then, there is much gnashing of teeth and useless cursings,
      but nothing serious or definite is done to smother those accursed English
      flies which come buzzing about our ears.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! you forget, Citizen Chauvelin,” retorted Robespierre, “that we of
      the Committee of Public Safety are far more helpless than you. You know
      the language of these people, we don't. You know their manners and
      customs, their ways of thought, the methods they are likely to employ: we
      know none of these things. You have seen and spoken to men in England who
      are members of that damned League. You have seen the man who is its
      leader. We have not.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He leant forward on the table and looked more searchingly at the thin,
      pallid face before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you named that leader to me now, if you described him, we could go to
      work more easily. You could name him, and you would, Citizen Chauvelin.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot,” retorted Chauvelin doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! but I think you could. But there! I do not blame your silence. You
      would wish to reap the reward of your own victory, to be the instrument of
      your own revenge. Passions! I think it natural! But in the name of your
      own safety, Citizen, do not be too greedy with your secret. If the man is
      known to you, find him again, find him, lure him to France! We want him—the
      people want him! And if the people do not get what they want, they will
      turn on those who have withheld their prey.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I understand, Citizen, that your own safety and that of your government
      is involved in this renewed attempt to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel,”
       retorted Chauvelin drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And your head, Citizen Chauvelin,” concluded Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! I know that well enough, and you may believe me, and you will,
      Citizen, when I say that I care but little about that. The question is, if
      I am to lure that man to France what will you and your government do to
      help me?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Everything,” replied Robespierre, “provided you have a definite plan and
      a definite purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have both. But I must go to England in, at least, a semi-official
      capacity. I can do nothing if I am to hide in disguise in out-of-the-way
      corners.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “That is easily done. There has been some talk with the British
      authorities anent the security and welfare of peaceful French subjects
      settled in England. After a good deal of correspondence they have
      suggested our sending a semi-official representative over there to look
      after the interests of our own people commercially and financially. We can
      easily send you over in that capacity if it would suit your purpose.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Admirably. I have only need of a cloak. That one will do as well as
      another.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Is that all?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Not quite. I have several plans in my head, and I must know that I am
      fully trusted. Above all, I must have power—decisive, absolute,
      illimitable power.”
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing of the weakling about this small, sable-clad man, who
      looked the redoubtable Jacobin leader straight in the face and brought a
      firm fist resolutely down upon the table before him. Robespierre paused a
      while ere he replied; he was eying the other man keenly, trying to read if
      behind that earnest, frowning brow there did not lurk some selfish,
      ulterior motive along with that demand for absolute power.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chauvelin did not flinch beneath that gaze which could make every
      cheek in France blanch with unnamed terror, and after that slight moment
      of hesitation Robespierre said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You shall have the complete power of a military dictator in every town or
      borough of France which you may visit. The Revolutionary Government shall
      create you, before you start for England, Supreme Head of all the
      Sub-Committees of Public Safety. This will mean that in the name of the
      safety of the Republic every order given by you, of whatsoever nature it
      might be, must be obeyed implicitly under pain of an arraignment for
      treason.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin sighed a quick, sharp sigh of intense satisfaction, which he did
      not even attempt to disguise before Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall want agents,” he said, “or shall we say spies? and, of course,
      money.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You shall have both. We keep a very efficient secret service in England
      and they do a great deal of good over there. There is much dissatisfaction
      in their Midland counties—you remember the Birmingham riots? They
      were chiefly the work of our own spies. Then you know Candeille, the
      actress? She had found her way among some of those circles in London who
      have what they call liberal tendencies. I believe they are called Whigs.
      Funny name, isn't it? It means perruque, I think. Candeille has given
      charity performances in aid of our Paris poor, in one or two of these Whig
      clubs, and incidentally she has been very useful to us.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A woman is always useful in such cases. I shall seek out the Citizeness
      Candeille.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And if she renders you useful assistance, I think I can offer her what
      should prove a tempting prize. Women are so vain!” he added, contemplating
      with rapt attention the enamel-like polish on his finger-nails. “There is
      a vacancy in the Maison Moliere. Or—what might prove more attractive
      still—in connection with the proposed National fete, and the new
      religion for the people, we have not yet chosen a Goddess of Reason. That
      should appeal to any feminine mind. The impersonation of a goddess, with
      processions, pageants, and the rest... Great importance and prominence
      given to one personality.... What say you, Citizen? If you really have
      need of a woman for the furtherance of your plans, you have that at your
      disposal which may enhance her zeal.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, Citizen,” rejoined Chauvelin calmly. “I always entertained a
      hope that some day the Revolutionary Government would call again on my
      services. I admit that I failed last year. The Englishman is resourceful.
      He has wits and he is very rich. He would not have succeeded, I think, but
      for his money—and corruption and bribery are rife in Paris and on
      our coasts. He slipped through my fingers at the very moment when I
      thought that I held him most securely. I do admit all that, but I am
      prepared to redeem my failure of last year, and... there is nothing more
      to discuss.—I am ready to start.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round for his cloak and hat, and quietly readjusted the set of
      his neck-tie. But Robespierre detained him a while longer: that born
      mountebank, born torturer of the souls of men, had not gloated
      sufficiently yet on the agony of mind of this fellow-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had always been trusted and respected. His services in
      connection with the foreign affairs of the Revolutionary Government had
      been invaluable, both before and since the beginning of the European War.
      At one time he formed part of that merciless decemvirate which—with
      Robespierre at its head—meant to govern France by laws of bloodshed
      and of unparalleled ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sea-green Incorruptible had since tired of him, then had
      endeavoured to push him on one side, for Chauvelin was keen and clever,
      and, moreover, he possessed all those qualities of selfless patriotism
      which were so conspicuously lacking in Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      His failure in bringing that interfering Scarlet Pimpernel to justice and
      the guillotine had completed Chauvelin's downfall. Though not otherwise
      molested, he had been left to moulder in obscurity during this past year.
      He would soon enough have been completely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was not only to be given one more chance to regain public favour,
      but he had demanded powers which in consideration of the aim in view,
      Robespierre himself could not refuse to grant him. But the Incorruptible,
      ever envious and jealous, would not allow him to exult too soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic blandness he seemed to be entering into all
      Chauvelin's schemes, to be helping in every way he could, for there was
      something at the back of his mind which he meant to say to the
      ex-ambassador, before the latter took his leave: something which would
      show him that he was but on trial once again, and which would demonstrate
      to him with perfect clearness that over him there hovered the all-powerful
      hand of a master.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have but to name the sum you want, Citizen Chauvelin,” said the
      Incorruptible, with an encouraging smile, “the government will not stint
      you, and you shall not fail for lack of authority or for lack of funds.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is pleasant to hear that the government has such uncounted wealth,”
       remarked Chauvelin with dry sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! the last few weeks have been very profitable,” retorted Robespierre;
      “we have confiscated money and jewels from emigrant royalists to the tune
      of several million francs. You remember the traitor Juliette Marny, who
      escape to England lately? Well! her mother's jewels and quite a good deal
      of gold were discovered by one of our most able spies to be under the care
      of a certain Abbe Foucquet, a calotin from Boulogne—devoted to the
      family, so it seems.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes?” queried Chauvelin indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Our men seized the jewels and gold, that is all. We don't know yet what
      we mean to do with the priest. The fisherfolk of Boulogne like him, and we
      can lay our hands on him at any time, if we want his old head for the
      guillotine. But the jewels were worth having. There's a historic necklace
      worth half a million at least.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Could I have it?” asked Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre laughed and shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You said it belonged to the Marny family,” continued the ex-ambassador.
      “Juliette Marny is in England. I might meet her. I cannot tell what may
      happen: but I feel that the historic necklace might prove useful. Just as
      you please,” he added with renewed indifference. “It was a thought that
      flashed through my mind when you spoke—nothing more.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And to show you how thoroughly the government trusts you, Citizen
      Chauvelin,” replied Robespierre with perfect urbanity, “I will myself
      direct that the Marny necklace be placed unreservedly in your hands; and a
      sum of fifty thousand francs for your expenses in England. You see,” he
      added blandly, “we give you no excuse for a second failure.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I need none,” retorted Chauvelin drily, as he finally rose from his seat,
      with a sigh of satisfaction that this interview was ended at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Robespierre too had risen, and pushing his chair aside he took a step
      or two towards Chauvelin. He was a much taller man than the ex-ambassador.
      Spare and gaunt, he had a very upright bearing, and in the uncertain light
      of the candle he seemed to tower strangely and weirdly above the other
      man: the pale hue of his coat, his light-coloured hair, the whiteness of
      his linen, all helped to give to his appearance at that moment a curious
      spectral effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin somehow felt an unpleasant shiver running down his spine as
      Robespierre, perfectly urbane and gentle in his manner, placed a long,
      bony hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Citizen Chauvelin,” said the Incorruptible, with some degree of dignified
      solemnity, “meseems that we very quickly understood one another this
      evening. Your own conscience, no doubt, gave you a premonition of what the
      purport of my summons to you would be. You say that you always hoped the
      Revolutionary Government would give you one great chance to redeem your
      failure of last year. I, for one, always intended that you should have
      that chance, for I saw, perhaps, just a little deeper into your heart than
      my colleagues. I saw not only enthusiasm for the cause of the People of
      France, not only abhorrence for the enemy of your country, I saw a purely
      personal and deadly hate of an individual man—the unknown and
      mysterious Englishman who proved too clever for you last year. And because
      I believe that hatred will prove sharper and more far-seeing than selfless
      patriotism, therefore I urged the Committee of Public Safety to allow you
      to work out your own revenge, and thereby to serve your country more
      effectually than any other—perhaps more pure-minded patriot would
      do. You go to England well-provided with all that is necessary for the
      success of your plans, for the accomplishment of your own personal
      vengeance. The Revolutionary Government will help you with money,
      passports, safe conducts; it places its spies and agents at your disposal.
      It gives you practically unlimited power, wherever you may go. It will not
      enquire into your motives, nor yet your means, so long as these lead to
      success. But private vengeance or patriotism, whatever may actuate you, we
      here in France demand you deliver into our hands the man who is known in
      two countries as the Scarlet Pimpernel! We want him alive if possible, or
      dead if it must be so, and we want as many of his henchmen as will follow
      him to the guillotine. Get them to France, and we'll know how to deal with
      them, and let the whole of Europe be damned.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a while, his hand still resting on Chauvelin's shoulder, his
      pale green eyes holding those of the other man as if in a trance. But
      Chauvelin neither stirred nor spoke. His triumph left him quite calm; his
      fertile brain was already busy with his plans. There was no room for fear
      in his heart, and it was without the slightest tremor that he waited for
      the conclusion of Robespierre's oration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps, Citizen Chauvelin,” said the latter at last, “you have already
      guessed what there is left for me to say. But lest there should remain in
      your mind one faint glimmer of doubt or of hope, let me tell you this. The
      Revolutionary Government gives you this chance of redeeming your failure,
      but this one only; if you fail again, your outraged country will know
      neither pardon nor mercy. Whether you return to France or remain in
      England, whether you travel North, South, East or West, cross the Oceans,
      or traverse the Alps, the hand of an avenging People will be upon you.
      Your second failure will be punished by death, wherever you may be, either
      by the guillotine, if you are in France, or if you seek refuge elsewhere,
      then by the hand of an assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look to it, Citizen Chauvelin! for there will be no escape this time, not
      even if the mightiest tyrant on earth tried to protect you, not even if
      you succeeded in building up an empire and placing yourself upon a
      throne.”
     </p>
    <p>
      His thin, strident voice echoed weirdly in the small, close boudoir.
      Chauvelin made no reply. There was nothing that he could say. All that
      Robespierre had put so emphatically before him, he had fully realised,
      even whilst he was forming his most daring plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an “either—or” this time, uttered to HIM now. He thought
      again of Marguerite Blakeney, and the terrible alternative he had put
      before HER less than a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! he was prepared to take the risk. He would not fail again. He was
      going to England under more favourable conditions this time. He knew who
      the man was, whom he was bidden to lure to France and to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he returned Robespierre's threatening gaze boldly and unflinchingly;
      then he prepared to go. He took up his hat and cloak, opened the door and
      peered for a moment into the dark corridor, wherein, in the far distance,
      the steps of a solitary sentinel could be faintly heard: he put on his
      hat, turned to look once more into the room where Robespierre stood
      quietly watching him, and went his way.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter IV: The Richmond Gala
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was perhaps the most brilliant September ever known in England, where
      the last days of dying summer are nearly always golden and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that in this country, where that same season is so peculiarly
      radiant with a glory all its own, there should be no special expression in
      the language with which to accurately name it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we needs must call it “fin d'ete”: the ending of the summer; not the
      absolute end, nor yet the ultimate departure, but the tender lingering of
      a friend obliged to leave us anon, yet who fain would steal a day here and
      there, a week or so in which to stay with us: who would make that last
      pathetic farewell of his endure a little while longer still, and brings
      forth in gorgeous array for our final gaze all that he has which is most
      luxuriant, most desirable, most worthy of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this year of grace 1793, departing summer had lavished the
      treasures of her palette upon woodland and river banks; had tinged the
      once crude green of larch and elm with a tender hue of gold, had brushed
      the oaks with tones of warm russet, and put patches of sienna and crimson
      on the beech.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gardens the roses were still in bloom, not the delicate blush or
      lemon ones of June, nor yet the pale Banksias and climbers, but the
      full-blooded red roses of late summer, and deep-coloured apricot ones,
      with crinkled outside leaves faintly kissed by the frosty dew. In
      sheltered spots the purple clematis still lingered, whilst the dahlias,
      brilliant of hue, seemed overbearing in their gorgeous insolence,
      flaunting their crudely colored petals against sober backgrounds of mellow
      leaves, or the dull, mossy tones of ancient, encircling walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gala had always been held about the end of September. The weather, on
      the riverside, was most dependable then, and there was always sufficient
      sunshine as an excuse for bringing out Madam's last new muslin gown, or
      her pale-coloured quilted petticoat. Then the ground was dry and hard,
      good alike for walking and for setting up tents and booths. And of these
      there was of a truth a most goodly array this year: mountebanks and
      jugglers from every corner of the world, so it seemed, for there was a man
      with a face as black as my lord's tricorne, and another with such flat
      yellow cheeks as made one think of batter pudding, and spring aconite, of
      eggs and other very yellow things.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tent wherein dogs—all sorts of dogs, big, little, black,
      white or tan—did things which no Christian with respect for his own
      backbone would have dared to perform, and another where a weird-faced old
      man made bean-stalks and walking sticks, coins of the realm and lace
      kerchiefs vanish into thin air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as it was nice and hot one could sit out upon the green and listen to
      the strains of the band, which discoursed sweet music, and watch the young
      people tread a measure on the sward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality had not yet arrived: for humbler folk had partaken of very
      early dinner so as to get plenty of fun, and long hours of delight for the
      sixpenny toll demanded at the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much to see and so much to do: games of bowls on the green,
      and a beautiful Aunt Sally, there was a skittle alley, and two
      merry-go-rounds: there were performing monkeys and dancing bears, a woman
      so fat that three men with arms outstretched could not get round her, and
      a man so thin that he could put a lady's bracelet round his neck and her
      garter around his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some funny little dwarfs with pinched faces and a knowing
      manner, and a giant come all the way from Russia—so 'twas said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanical toys too were a great attraction. You dropped a penny into
      a little slit in a box and a doll would begin to dance and play the
      fiddle: and there was the Magic Mill, where for another modest copper a
      row of tiny figures, wrinkled and old and dressed in the shabbiest of
      rags, marched in weary procession up a flight of steps into the Mill, only
      to emerge again the next moment at a further door of this wonderful
      building looking young and gay, dressed in gorgeous finery and tripping a
      dance measure as they descended some steps and were finally lost to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was most wonderful of all and collected the goodliest crowd of
      gazers and the largest amount of coins, was a miniature representation of
      what was going on in France even at this very moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you could not help but be convinced of the truth of it all, so
      cleverly was it done. There was a background of houses and a very
      red-looking sky. “Too red!” some people said, but were immediately quashed
      by the dictum of the wise, that the sky represented a sunset, as anyone
      who looked could see. Then there were a number of little figures, no
      taller than your hand, but with little wooden faces and arms and legs,
      just beautifully made little dolls, and these were dressed in kirtles and
      breeches—all rags mostly—and little coats and wooden shoes.
      They were massed together in groups with their arms all turned upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the center of this little stage on an elevated platform there were
      miniature wooden posts close together, and with a long flat board at right
      angles at the foot of the posts, and all painted a bright red. At the
      further end of the boards was a miniature basket, and between the two
      posts, at the top, was a miniature knife which ran up and down in a groove
      and was drawn by a miniature pulley. Folk who knew said that this was a
      model of a guillotine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And lo and behold! when you dropped a penny into a slot just below the
      wooden stage, the crowd of little figures started waving their arms up and
      down, and another little doll would ascend the elevated platform and lie
      down on the red board at the foot of the wooden posts. Then a figure
      dressed in brilliant scarlet put out an arm presumably to touch the
      pulley, and the tiny knife would rattle down on to the poor little
      reclining doll's neck, and its head would roll off into the basket beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a loud whirr of wheels, a buzz of internal mechanism, and
      all the little figures would stop dead with arms outstretched, whilst the
      beheaded doll rolled off the board and was lost to view, no doubt
      preparatory to going through the same gruesome pantomime again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very thrilling, and very terrible: a certain air of hushed awe
      reigned in the booth where this mechanical wonder was displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The booth itself stood in a secluded portion of the grounds, far from the
      toll gates, and the band stand and the noise of the merry-go-round, and
      there were great texts, written in red letters on a black ground, pinned
      all along the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Please spare a copper for the starving poor of Paris.”
     </p>
    <p>
      A lady, dressed in grey quilted petticoat and pretty grey and black
      striped paniers, could be seen walking in the booth from time to time,
      then disappearing through a partition beyond. She would emerge again
      presently carrying an embroidered reticule, and would wander round among
      the crowd, holding out the bag by its chain, and repeating in tones of
      somewhat monotonous appeal: “For the starving poor of Paris, if you
      please!”
     </p>
    <p>
      She had fine, dark eyes, rather narrow and tending upwards at the outer
      corners, which gave her face a not altogether pleasant expression. Still,
      they were fine eyes, and when she went round soliciting alms, most of the
      men put a hand into their breeches pocket and dropped a coin into her
      embroidered reticule.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said the word “poor” in rather a funny way, rolling the “r” at the
      end, and she also said “please” as if it were spelt with a long line of
      “e's,” and so it was concluded that she was French and was begging for her
      poorer sisters. At stated intervals during the day, the mechanical toy was
      rolled into a corner, and the lady in grey stood up on a platform and sang
      queer little songs, the words of which nobody could understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Il etait une bergere et ron et ron, petit patapon....”
     </p>
    <p>
      But it all left an impression of sadness and of suppressed awe upon the
      minds and susceptibilities of the worthy Richmond yokels come with their
      wives or sweethearts to enjoy the fun of the fair, and gladly did everyone
      emerge out of that melancholy booth into the sunshine, the brightness and
      the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud! but she do give me the creeps,” said Mistress Polly, the pretty
      barmaid from the Bell Inn, down by the river. “And I must say that I don't
      see why we English folk should send our hard-earned pennies to those
      murdering ruffians over the water. Bein' starving so to speak, don't make
      a murderer a better man if he goes on murdering,” she added with
      undisputable if ungrammatical logic. “Come, let's look at something more
      cheerful now.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And without waiting for anyone else's assent, she turned towards the more
      lively portion of the grounds, closely followed by a ruddy-faced, somewhat
      sheepish-looking youth, who very obviously was her attendant swain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting on for three o-clock now, and the quality were beginning to
      arrive. Lord Anthony Dewhurst was already there, chucking every pretty
      girl under the chin, to the annoyance of her beau. Ladies were arriving
      all the time, and the humbler feminine hearts were constantly set
      a-flutter at sight of rich brocaded gowns, and the new Charlottes, all
      crinkled velvet and soft marabout, which were so becoming to the pretty
      faces beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was incessant and loud talking and chattering, with here and there
      the shriller tones of a French voice being distinctly noticeable in the
      din. There were a good many French ladies and gentlemen present, easily
      recognisable, even in the distance, for their clothes were of more sober
      hue and of lesser richness than those of their English compeers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were great lords and ladies, nevertheless, Dukes and Duchesses
      and Countesses, come to England for fear of being murdered by those devils
      in their own country. Richmond was full of them just now, as they were
      made right welcome both at the Palace and at the magnificent home of Sir
      Percy and Lady Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! here comes Sir Andrew Ffoulkes with his lady! so pretty and dainty
      does she look, like a little china doll, in her new-fashioned
      short-waisted gown: her brown hair in soft waves above her smooth
      forehead, her great, hazel eyes fixed in unaffected admiration on the
      gallant husband by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No wonder she dotes on him!” sighed pretty Mistress Polly after she had
      bobbed her curtsy to my lady. “The brave deeds he did for love of her!
      Rescued her from those murderers over in France and brought her to England
      safe and sound, having fought no end of them single-handed, so I've heard
      it said. Have you not, Master Thomas Jezzard?”
     </p>
    <p>
      And she looked defiantly at her meek-looking cavalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah!” replied Master Thomas with quite unusual vehemence in response to
      the disparaging look in her brown eyes, “'Tis not he who did it all, as
      you well know, Mistress Polly. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes is a gallant gentleman,
      you may take your Bible oath on that, but he that fights the murdering
      frogeaters single-handed is he whom they call The Scarlet Pimpernel: the
      bravest gentleman in all the world.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as at mention of the national hero, he thought that he detected in
      Mistress Polly's eyes an enthusiasm which he could not very well ascribe
      to his own individuality, he added with some pique:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But they do say that this same Scarlet Pimpernel is mightily
      ill-favoured, and that's why no one ever sees him. They say he is fit to
      scare the crows away and that no Frenchy can look twice at his face, for
      it's so ugly, and so they let him get out of the country, rather than look
      at him again.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then they do say a mighty lot of nonsense,” retorted Mistress Polly, with
      a shrug of her pretty shoulders, “and if that be so, then why don't you go
      over to France and join hands with the Scarlet Pimpernel? I'll warrant no
      Frenchman'll want to look twice at your face.”
     </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of laughter greeted this sally, for the two young people had in
      the meanwhile been joined by several of their friends, and now formed part
      of a merry group near the band, some sitting, others standing, but all
      bent on seeing as much as there was to see in Richmond Gala this day.
      There was Johnny Cullen, the grocer's apprentice from Twickenham, and
      Ursula Quekett, the baker's daughter, and several “young 'uns” from the
      neighbourhood, as well as some older folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all of them enjoyed a joke when they heard one and thought Mistress
      Polly's retort mightily smart. But then Mistress Polly was possessed of
      two hundred pounds, all her own, left to her by her grandmother, and on
      the strength of this extensive fortune had acquired a reputation for
      beauty and wit not easily accorded to a wench that had been penniless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mistress Polly was also very kind-hearted. She loved to tease Master
      Jezzard, who was an indefatigable hanger-on at her pretty skirts, and
      whose easy conquest had rendered her somewhat contemptuous, but at the
      look of perplexed annoyance and bewildered distress in the lad's face, her
      better nature soon got the upper hand. She realized that her remark had
      been unwarrantably spiteful, and wishing to make atonement, she said with
      a touch of coquetry which quickly spread balm over the honest yokel's
      injured vanity:
    </p>
    <p>
      “La! Master Jezzard, you do seem to make a body say some queer things. But
      there! you must own 'tis mighty funny about that Scarlet Pimpernel!” she
      added, appealing to the company in general, just as if Master Jezzard had
      been disputing the fact. “Why won't he let anyone see who he is? And those
      who know him won't tell. Now I have it for a fact from my lady's own maid
      Lucy, that the young lady as is stopping at Lady Blakeney's house has
      actually spoken to the man. She came over from France, come a fortnight
      to-morrow; she and the gentleman they call Mossoo Deroulede. They both saw
      the Scarlet Pimpernel and spoke to him. He brought them over from France.
      Then why won't they say?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Say what?” commented Johnny Cullen, the apprentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who this mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel is.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps he isn't,” said old Clutterbuck, who was clerk of the vestry at
      the church of St. John's the Evangelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes!” he added sententiously, for he was fond of his own sayings and
      usually liked to repeat them before he had quite done with them, “that's
      it, you may be sure. Perhaps he isn't.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean, Master Clutterbuck?” asked Ursula Quekett, for she knew
      the old man liked to explain his wise saws, and as she wanted to marry his
      son, she indulged him whenever she could. “What do you mean? He isn't
      what?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “He isn't. That's all,” explained Clutterbuck with vague solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then seeing that he had gained the attention of the little party round
      him, he condescended to come to more logical phraseology.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I mean, that perhaps we must not ask, 'who IS this mysterious Scarlet
      Pimpernel?' but 'who WAS that poor and unfortunate gentleman?'”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then you think...” suggested Mistress Polly, who felt unaccountably
      low-spirited at this oratorical pronouncement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have it for a fact,” said Mr. Clutterbuck solemnly, “that he whom they
      call the Scarlet Pimpernel no longer exists now: that he was collared by
      the Frenchies, as far back as last fall, and in the language of the poets,
      has never been heard of no more.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clutterbuck was very fond of quoting from the works of certain writers
      whose names he never mentioned, but who went by the poetical generality of
      “the poets.” Whenever he made use of phrases which he was supposed to
      derive from these great and unnamed authors, he solemnly and mechanically
      raised his hat, as a tribute of respect to these giant minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You think that The Scarlet Pimpernel is dead, Mr. Clutterbuck? That those
      horrible Frenchies murdered him? Surely you don't mean that?” sighed
      Mistress Polly ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clutterbuck put his hand up to his hat, preparatory no doubt to making
      another appeal to the mysterious poets, but was interrupted in the very
      act of uttering great thoughts by a loud and prolonged laugh which came
      echoing from a distant corner of the grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud! but I'd know that laugh anywhere,” said Mistress Quekett, whilst all
      eyes were turned in the direction whence the merry noise had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a head taller than any of his friends around him, his lazy blue eyes
      scanning from beneath their drooping lids the motley throng around him,
      stood Sir Percy Blakeney, the centre of a gaily-dressed little group which
      seemingly had just crossed the toll-gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A fine specimen of a man, for sure,” remarked Johnnie Cullen, the
      apprentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! you may take your Bible oath on that!” sighed Mistress Polly, who
      was inclined to be sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Speakin' as the poets,” pronounced Mr. Clutterbuck sententiously, “inches
      don't make a man.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nor fine clothes neither,” added Master Jezzard, who did not approve of
      Mistress Polly's sentimental sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There's my lady!” gasped Miss Barbara suddenly, clutching Master
      Clutterbuck's arm vigorously. “Lud! but she is beautiful to-day!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful indeed, and radiant with youth and happiness, Marguerite
      Blakeney had just gone through the gates and was walking along the sward
      towards the band stand. She was dressed in clinging robes of shimmery
      green texture, the new-fashioned high-waisted effect suiting her graceful
      figure to perfection. The large Charlotte, made of velvet to match the
      gown, cast a deep shadow over the upper part of her face, and gave a
      peculiar softness to the outline of her forehead and cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long lace mittens covered her arms and hands and a scarf of diaphanous
      material edged with dull gold hung loosely around her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! she was beautiful! No captious chronicler has ever denied that! and
      no one who knew her before, and who saw her again on this late summer's
      afternoon, could fail to mark the additional charm of her magnetic
      personality. There was a tenderness in her face as she turned her head to
      and fro, a joy of living in her eyes that was quite irresistibly
      fascinating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now she was talking animatedly with the young girl who was walking
      beside her, and laughing merrily the while:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! we'll find your Paul, never fear! Lud! child, have you forgotten he
      is in England now, and that there's no fear of his being kidnapped here on
      the green in broad daylight.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl gave a slight shudder and her child-like face became a
      shade paler than before. Marguerite took her hand and gave it a kindly
      pressure. Juliette Marny, but lately come to England, saved from under the
      very knife of the guillotine, by a timely and daring rescue, could
      scarcely believe as yet that she and the man she loved were really out of
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is Monsieur Deroulede,” said Marguerite after a slight pause,
      giving the young girl time to recover herself and pointing to a group of
      men close by. “He is among friends, as you see.”
     </p>
    <p>
      They made such a pretty picture, these two women, as they stood together
      for a moment on the green with the brilliant September sun throwing golden
      reflections and luminous shadows on their slender forms. Marguerite, tall
      and queen-like in her rich gown, and costly jewels, wearing with glorious
      pride the invisible crown of happy wifehood: Juliette, slim and girlish,
      dressed all in white, with a soft, straw hat on her fair curls, and
      bearing on an otherwise young and child-like face, the hard imprint of the
      terrible sufferings she had undergone, of the deathly moral battle her
      tender soul had had to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon a group of friends joined them. Paul Deroulede among these, also Sir
      Andrew and Lady Ffoulkes, and strolling slowly towards them, his hands
      buried in the pockets of his fine cloth breeches, his broad shoulders set
      to advantage in a coat of immaculate cut, priceless lace ruffles at neck
      and wrist, came the inimitable Sir Percy.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter V: Sir Percy and His Lady
    </h2>
    <p>
      To all appearances he had not changed since those early days of matrimony,
      when his young wife dazzled London society by her wit and by her beauty,
      and he was one of the many satellites that helped to bring into bold
      relief the brilliance of her presence, of her sallies and of her smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friends alone, mayhap—and of these only an intimate few—had
      understood that beneath that self-same lazy manner, those shy and awkward
      ways, that half-inane, half-cynical laugh, there now lurked an
      undercurrent of tender and passionate happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Lady Blakeney was in love with her own husband, nobody could fail to
      see, and in the more frivolous cliques of fashionable London this
      extraordinary phenomenon had oft been eagerly discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A monstrous thing, of a truth, for a woman of fashion to adore her own
      husband!” was the universal pronouncement of the gaily-decked little world
      that centred around Carlton House and Ranelagh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that Sir Percy Blakeney was unpopular with the fair sex. Far be it
      from the veracious chronicler's mind even to suggest such a thing. The
      ladies would have voted any gathering dull if Sir Percy's witty sallies
      did not ring from end to end of the dancing hall, if his new satin coat
      and 'broidered waistcoat did not call for comment or admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was the frivolous set, to which Lady Blakeney had never belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well known that she had always viewed her good-natured husband as
      the most willing and most natural butt for her caustic wit; she still was
      fond of aiming a shaft or two at him, and he was still equally ready to
      let the shaft glance harmlessly against the flawless shield of his own
      imperturbable good humour, but now, contrary to all precedent, to all
      usages and customs of London society, Marguerite seldom was seen at routs
      or at the opera without her husband; she accompanied him to all the races,
      and even one night—oh horror!—had danced the gavotte with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society shuddered and wondered! tried to put Lady Blakeney's sudden
      infatuation down to foreign eccentricity, and finally consoled itself with
      the thought that after all this nonsense could not last, and that she was
      too clever a woman and he too perfect a gentleman to keep up this abnormal
      state of things for any length of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the ladies averred that this matrimonial love was a very
      one-sided affair. No one could assert that Sir Percy was anything but
      politely indifferent to his wife's obvious attentions. His lazy eyes never
      once lighted up when she entered a ball-room, and there were those who
      knew for a fact that her ladyship spent many lonely days in her beautiful
      home at Richmond whilst her lord and master absented himself with
      persistent if unchivalrous regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His presence at the Gala had been a surprise to everyone, for all thought
      him still away, fishing in Scotland or shooting in Yorkshire, anywhere
      save close to the apron strings of his doting wife. He himself seemed
      conscious of the fact that he had not been expected at this end-of-summer
      fete, for as he strolled forward to meet his wife and Juliette Marny, and
      acknowledge with a bow here and a nod there the many greetings from
      subordinates and friends, there was quite an apologetic air about his
      good-looking face, and an obvious shyness in his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marguerite gave a happy little laugh when she saw him coming towards
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Sir Percy!” she said gaily, “and pray have you seen the show? I vow
      'tis the maddest, merriest throng I've seen for many a day. Nay! but for
      the sighs and shudders of my poor little Juliette, I should be enjoying
      one of the liveliest days of my life.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She patted Juliette's arm affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not shame me before Sir Percy,” murmured the young girl, casting shy
      glances at the elegant cavalier before her, vainly trying to find in the
      indolent, foppish personality of this society butterfly, some trace of the
      daring man of action, the bold adventurer who had snatched her and her
      lover from out the very tumbril that bore them both to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know I ought to be gay,” she continued with an attempt at a smile, “I
      ought to forget everything, save what I owe to...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy's laugh broke in on her half-finished sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud! and to think of all that I ought not to forget!” he said loudly.
      “Tony here has been clamouring for iced punch this last half-hour, and I
      promised to find a booth wherein the noble liquid is properly dispensed.
      Within half an hour from now His Royal Highness will be here. I assure
      you, Mlle. Juliette, that from that time onwards I have to endure the
      qualms of the damned, for the heir to Great Britain's throne always
      contrives to be thirsty when I am satiated, which is Tantalus' torture
      magnified a thousandfold, or to be satiated when my parched palate most
      requires solace; in either case I am a most pitiable man.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “In either case you contrive to talk a deal of nonsense, Sir Percy,” said
      Marguerite gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What else would your ladyship have me do this lazy, hot afternoon?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Come and view the booths with me,” she said. “I am dying for a sight of
      the fat woman and the lean man, the pig-faced child, the dwarfs and the
      giants. There! Monsieur Deroulede,” she added, turning to the young
      Frenchman who was standing close beside her, “take Mlle. Juliette to hear
      the clavecin players. I vow she is tired of my company.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The gaily-dressed group was breaking up. Juliette and Paul Deroulede were
      only too ready to stroll off arm-in-arm together, and Sir Andrew Ffoulkes
      was ever in attendance on his young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment Marguerite caught her husband's eye. No one was within
      earshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, m'dear.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “When did you return?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Early this morning.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You crossed over from Calais?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “From Boulogne.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why did you not let me know sooner?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I could not, dear. I arrived at my lodgings in town, looking a disgusting
      object.... I could not appear before you until I had washed some of the
      French mud from off my person. Then His Royal Highness demanded my
      presence. He wanted news of the Duchesse de Verneuil, whom I had the
      honour of escorting over from France. By the time I had told him all that
      he wished to hear, there was no chance of finding you at home, and I
      thought I should see you here.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite said nothing for a moment, but her foot impatiently tapped the
      ground, and her fingers were fidgeting with the gold fringe of her scarf.
      The look of joy, of exquisite happiness, seemed to have suddenly vanished
      from her face; there was a deep furrow between her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed a short, sharp sigh, and cast a rapid upward glance at her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking down at her, smiling good-naturedly, a trifle sarcastically
      perhaps, and the frown on her face deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy,” she said abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, m'dear.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “These anxieties are terrible to bear. You have been twice over to France
      within the last month, dealing with your life as lightly as if it did not
      now belong to me. When will you give up these mad adventures, and leave
      others to fight their own battles and to save their own lives as best they
      may?”
     </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken with increased vehemence, although her voice was scarce
      raised above a whisper. Even in her sudden, passionate anger she was on
      her guard not to betray his secret. He did not reply immediately, but
      seemed to be studying the beautiful face on which heartbroken anxiety was
      now distinctly imprinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned and looked at the solitary booth in the distance, across
      the frontal of which a large placard had been recently affixed, bearing
      the words: “Come and see the true representation of the guillotine!”
     </p>
    <p>
      In front of the booth a man dressed in ragged breeches, with Phrygian cap
      on his head, adorned with a tri-colour cockade, was vigorously beating a
      drum, shouting volubly the while:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come in and see, come in and see! the only realistic presentation of the
      original guillotine. Hundreds perish in Paris every day! Come and see!
      Come and see! the perfectly vivid performance of what goes on hourly in
      Paris at the present moment.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite had followed the direction of Sir Percy's eyes. She too was
      looking at the booth, she heard the man's monotonous, raucous cries. She
      gave a slight shudder and once more looked imploringly at her husband. His
      face—though outwardly as lazy and calm as before—had a strange
      set look about the mouth and firm jaw, and his slender hand, the hand of a
      dandy accustomed to handle cards and dice and to play lightly with the
      foils, was clutched tightly beneath the folds of the priceless Mechlin
      frills.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a momentary stiffening of the whole powerful frame, an
      instant's flash of the ruling passion hidden within that very secretive
      soul. Then he once more turned towards her, the rigid lines of his face
      relaxed, he broke into a pleasant laugh, and with the most elaborate and
      most courtly bow he took her hand in his and raising her fingers to his
      lips, he gave the answer to her questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      “When your ladyship has ceased to be the most admired woman in Europe,
      namely, when I am in my grave.”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter VI: For the Poor of Paris
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was no time to say more then. For the laughing, chatting groups of
      friends had once more closed up round Marguerite and her husband, and she,
      ever on the alert, gave neither look nor sign that any serious
      conversation had taken place between Sir Percy and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she might feel or dread with regard to the foolhardy adventures
      in which he still persistently embarked, no member of the League ever
      guarded the secret of his chief more loyally than did Marguerite Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though her heart overflowed with a passionate pride in her husband, she
      was clever enough to conceal every emotion save that which Nature had
      insisted on imprinting in her face, her present radiant happiness and her
      irresistible love. And thus before the world she kept up that bantering
      way with him, which had characterized her earlier matrimonial life, that
      good-natured, easy contempt which he had so readily accepted in those
      days, and which their entourage would have missed and would have enquired
      after, if she had changed her manner towards him too suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her heart she knew full well that within Percy Blakeney's soul she had
      a great and powerful rival: his wild, mad, passionate love of adventure.
      For it he would sacrifice everything, even his life; she dared not ask
      herself if he would sacrifice his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice in a few weeks he had been over to France: every time he went she
      could not know if she would ever see him again. She could not imagine how
      the French Committee of Public Safety could so clumsily allow the hated
      Scarlet Pimpernel to slip through its fingers. But she never attempted
      either to warn him or to beg him not to go. When he brought Paul Deroulede
      and Juliette Marny over from France, her heart went out to the two young
      people in sheer gladness and pride because of his precious life, which he
      had risked for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved Juliette for the dangers Percy had passed, for the anxieties she
      herself had endured; only to-day, in the midst of this beautiful sunshine,
      this joy of the earth, of summer and of the sky, she had suddenly felt a
      mad, overpowering anxiety, a deadly hatred of the wild adventurous life,
      which took him so often away from her side. His pleasant, bantering reply
      precluded her following up the subject, whilst the merry chatter of people
      round her warned her to keep her words and looks under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she seemed now to feel the want of being alone, and, somehow, that
      distant booth with its flaring placard, and the crier in the Phrygian cap,
      exercised a weird fascination over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively she bent her steps thither, and equally instinctively the
      idle throng of her friends followed her. Sir Percy alone had halted in
      order to converse with Lord Hastings, who had just arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely, Lady Blakeney, you have no thought of patronising that gruesome
      spectacle?” said Lord Anthony Dewhurst, as Marguerite almost mechanically
      had paused within a few yards of the solitary booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know,” she said, with enforced gaiety, “the place seems to
      attract me. And I need not look at the spectacle,” she added
      significantly, as she pointed to a roughly-scribbled notice at the
      entrance of the tent: “In aid of the starving poor of Paris.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “There's a good-looking woman who sings, and a hideous mechanical toy that
      moves,” said one of the young men in the crowd. “It is very dark and close
      inside the tent. I was lured in there for my sins, and was in a mighty
      hurry to come out again.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then it must be my sins that are helping to lure me too at the present
      moment,” said Marguerite lightly. “I pray you all to let me go in there. I
      want to hear the good-looking woman sing, even if I do not see the hideous
      toy on the move.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “May I escort you then, Lady Blakeney?” said Lord Tony.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! I would rather go in alone,” she replied a trifle impatiently. “I
      beg of you not to heed my whim, and to await my return, there, where the
      music is at its merriest.”
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been bad manners to insist. Marguerite, with a little comprehensive
      nod to all her friends, left the young cavaliers still protesting and
      quickly passed beneath the roughly constructed doorway that gave access
      into the booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, dressed in theatrical rags and wearing the characteristic scarlet
      cap, stood immediately within the entrance, and ostentatiously rattled a
      money box at regular intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the starving poor of Paris,” he drawled out in nasal monotonous tones
      the moment he caught sight of Marguerite and of her rich gown. She dropped
      some gold into the box and then passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior of the booth was dark and lonely-looking after the glare of
      the hot September sun and the noisy crowd that thronged the sward outside.
      Evidently a performance had just taken place on the elevated platform
      beyond, for a few yokels seemed to be lingering in a desultory manner as
      if preparatory to going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few disjointed comments reached Marguerite's ears as she approached, and
      the small groups parted to allow her to pass. One or two women gaped in
      astonishment at her beautiful dress, whilst others bobbed a respectful
      curtsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanical toy arrested her attention immediately. She did not find it
      as gruesome as she expected, only singularly grotesque, with all those
      wooden little figures in their quaint, arrested action.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew nearer to have a better look, and the yokels who had lingered
      behind, paused, wondering if she would make any remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Her ladyship was born in France,” murmured one of the men, close to her,
      “she would know if the thing really looks like that.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “She do seem interested,” quoth another in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud love us all!” said a buxom wench, who was clinging to the arm of a
      nervous-looking youth, “I believe they're coming for more money.”
     </p>
    <p>
      On the elevated platform at the further end of the tent, a slim figure had
      just made its appearance, that of a young woman dressed in peculiarly
      sombre colours, and with a black lace hood thrown lightly over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite thought that the face seemed familiar to her, and she also
      noticed that the woman carried a large embroidered reticule in her
      bemittened hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general exodus the moment she appeared. The Richmond yokels
      did not like the look of that reticule. They felt that sufficient demand
      had already been made upon their scant purses, considering the meagerness
      of the entertainment, and they dreaded being lured to further
      extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marguerite turned away from the mechanical toy, the last of the
      little crowd had disappeared, and she was alone in the booth with the
      woman in the dark kirtle and black lace hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For the poor of Paris, Madame,” said the latter mechanically, holding out
      her reticule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite was looking at her intently. The face certainly seemed
      familiar, recalling to her mind the far-off days in Paris, before she
      married. Some young actress no doubt driven out of France by that terrible
      turmoil which had caused so much sorrow and so much suffering. The face
      was pretty, the figure slim and elegant, and the look of obvious sadness
      in the dark, almond-shaped eyes was calculated to inspire sympathy and
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, strangely enough, Lady Blakeney felt repelled and chilled by this
      sombrely-dressed young person: an instinct, which she could not have
      explained and which she felt had no justification, warned her that somehow
      or other, the sadness was not quite genuine, the appeal for the poor not
      quite heartfelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, she took out her purse, and dropping some few sovereigns
      into the capacious reticule, she said very kindly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope that you are satisfied with your day's work, Madame; I fear me our
      British country folk hold the strings of their purses somewhat tightly
      these times.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman sighed and shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Madame!” she said with a tone of great dejection, “one does what one
      can for one's starving countrymen, but it is very hard to elicit sympathy
      over here for them, poor dears!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You are a Frenchwoman, of course,” rejoined Marguerite, who had noted
      that though the woman spoke English with a very pronounced foreign accent,
      she had nevertheless expressed herself with wonderful fluency and
      correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Just like Lady Blakeney herself,” replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You know who I am?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who could come to Richmond and not know Lady Blakeney by sight.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But what made you come to Richmond on this philanthropic errand of
      yours?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I go where I think there is a chance of earning a little money for the
      cause which I have at heart,” replied the Frenchwoman with the same gentle
      simplicity, the same tone of mournful dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she said was undoubtedly noble and selfless. Lady Blakeney felt in
      her heart that her keenest sympathy should have gone out to this young
      woman—pretty, dainty, hardly more than a girl—who seemed to be
      devoting her young life in a purely philanthropic and unselfish cause. And
      yet in spite of herself, Marguerite seemed unable to shake off that
      curious sense of mistrust which had assailed her from the first, nor that
      feeling of unreality and staginess with which the Frenchwoman's attitude
      had originally struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she tried to be kind and to be cordial, tried to hide that coldness in
      her manner which she felt was unjustified.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is all very praiseworthy on your part, Madame,” she said somewhat
      lamely. “Madame...?” she added interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is Candeille—Desiree Candeille,” replied the Frenchwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Candeille?” exclaimed Marguerite with sudden alacrity, “Candeille...
      surely...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes... of the Varietes.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! then I know why your face from the first seemed familiar to me,” said
      Marguerite, this time with unaffected cordiality. “I must have applauded
      you many a time in the olden days. I am an ex-colleague, you know. My name
      was St. Just before I married, and I was of the Maison Moliere.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I knew that,” said Desiree Candeille, “and half hoped that you would
      remember me.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! who could forget Demoiselle Candeille, the most popular star in the
      theatrical firmament?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! that was so long ago.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Only four years.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A fallen star is soon lost out of sight.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why fallen?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It was a choice for me between exile from France and the guillotine,”
       rejoined Candeille simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely not?” queried Marguerite with a touch of genuine sympathy. With
      characteristic impulsiveness, she had now cast aside her former
      misgivings: she had conquered her mistrust, at any rate had relegated it
      to the background of her mind. This woman was a colleague: she had
      suffered and was in distress; she had every claim, therefore, on a
      compatriot's help and friendship. She stretched out her hand and took
      Desiree Candeille's in her own; she forced herself to feel nothing but
      admiration for this young woman, whose whole attitude spoke of sorrows
      nobly borne, of misfortunes proudly endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't know why I should sadden you with my story,” rejoined Desiree
      Candeille after a slight pause, during which she seemed to be waging war
      against her own emotion. “It is not a very interesting one. Hundreds have
      suffered as I did. I had enemies in Paris. God knows how that happened. I
      had never harmed anyone, but someone must have hated me and must have
      wished me ill. Evil is so easily wrought in France these days. A
      denunciation—a perquisition—an accusation—then the
      flight from Paris... the forged passports... the disguise... the bribe...
      the hardships... the squalid hiding places.... Oh! I have gone through it
      all... tasted every kind of humiliation... endured every kind of
      insult.... Remember! that I was not a noble aristocrat... a Duchess or an
      impoverished Countess...” she added with marked bitterness, “or perhaps
      the English cavaliers whom the popular voice has called the League of the
      Scarlet Pimpernel would have taken some interest in me. I was only a poor
      actress and had to find my way out of France alone, or else perish on the
      guillotine.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am so sorry!” said Marguerite simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell me how you got on, once you were in England,” she continued after a
      while, seeing that Desiree Candeille seemed absorbed in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had a few engagements at first,” replied the Frenchwoman. “I played at
      Sadler's Wells and with Mrs. Jordan at Covent Garden, but the Aliens' Bill
      put an end to my chances of livelihood. No manager cared to give me a
      part, and so...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And so?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! I had a few jewels and I sold them.... A little money and I live on
      that.... But when I played at Covent Garden I contrived to send part of my
      salary over to some of the poorer clubs of Paris. My heart aches for those
      that are starving.... Poor wretches, they are misguided and misled by
      self-seeking demagogues.... It hurts me to feel that I can do nothing more
      to help them... and eases my self-respect if, by singing at public fairs,
      I can still send a few francs to those who are poorer than myself.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken with ever-increasing passion and vehemence. Marguerite,
      with eyes fixed into vacancy, seeing neither the speaker nor her
      surroundings, seeing only visions of those same poor wreckages of
      humanity, who had been goaded into thirst for blood, when their shrunken
      bodies should have been clamouring for healthy food,—Marguerite thus
      absorbed, had totally forgotten her earlier prejudices and now completely
      failed to note all that was unreal, stagy, theatrical, in the oratorical
      declamations of the ex-actress from the Varietes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-eminently true and loyal herself in spite of the many deceptions and
      treacheries which she had witnessed in her life, she never looked for
      falsehood or for cant in others. Even now she only saw before her a woman
      who had been wrongfully persecuted, who had suffered and had forgiven
      those who had caused her to suffer. She bitterly accused herself for her
      original mistrust of this noble-hearted, unselfish woman, who was content
      to tramp around in an alien country, bartering her talents for a few
      coins, in order that some of those, who were the originators of her
      sorrows, might have bread to eat and a bed in which to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” she said warmly, “truly you shame me, who am also
      French-born, with the many sacrifices you so nobly make for those who
      should have first claim on my own sympathy. Believe me, if I have not done
      as much as duty demanded of me in the cause of my starving compatriots, it
      has not been for lack of good-will. Is there any way now,” she added
      eagerly, “in which I can help you? Putting aside the question of money,
      wherein I pray you to command my assistance, what can I do to be of useful
      service to you?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You are very kind, Lady Blakeney...” said the other hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well? What is it? I see there is something in your mind...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is perhaps difficult to express... but people say I have a good
      voice... I sing some French ditties... they are a novelty in England, I
      think.... If I could sing them in fashionable salons... I might
      perhaps...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! you shall sing in fashionable salons,” exclaimed Marguerite eagerly,
      “you shall become the fashion, and I'll swear the Prince of Wales himself
      shall bid you sing at Carlton House... and you shall name your own fee,
      Mademoiselle... and London society shall vie with the elite of Bath, as to
      which shall lure you to its most frequented routs.... There! there! you
      shall make a fortune for the Paris poor... and to prove to you that I mean
      every word I say, you shall begin your triumphant career in my own salon
      to-morrow night. His Royal Highness will be present. You shall sing your
      most engaging songs... and for your fee you must accept a hundred guineas,
      which you shall send to the poorest workman's club in Paris in the name of
      Sir Percy and Lady Blakeney.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I thank your ladyship, but...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You'll not refuse?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I'll accept gladly... but... you will understand... I am not very old,”
       said Candeille quaintly, “I... I am only an actress... but if a young
      actress is unprotected... then...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I understand,” replied Marguerite gently, “that you are far too pretty to
      frequent the world all alone, and that you have a mother, a sister or a
      friend... which?... whom you would wish to escort you to-morrow. Is that
      it?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay,” rejoined the actress, with marked bitterness, “I have neither
      mother, nor sister, but our Revolutionary Government, with tardy
      compassion for those it has so relentlessly driven out of France, has
      deputed a representative of theirs in England to look after the interests
      of French subjects over here!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “They have realised over in Paris that my life here has been devoted to
      the welfare of the poor people of France. The representative whom the
      government has sent to England is specially interested in me and in my
      work. He is a stand-by for me in case of trouble... in case of insults...
      A woman alone is oft subject to those, even at the hands of so-called
      gentlemen... and the official representative of my own country becomes in
      such cases my most natural protector.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I understand.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You will receive him?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then may I present him to your ladyship?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Whenever you like.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Now, and it please you.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. Here he comes, at your ladyship's service.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Desiree Candeille's almond-shaped eyes were fixed upon a distant part of
      the tent, behind Lady Blakeney in the direction of the main entrance to
      the booth. There was a slight pause after she had spoken and then
      Marguerite slowly turned in order to see who this official representative
      of France was, whom at the young actress' request she had just agreed to
      receive in her house. In the doorway of the tent, framed by its gaudy
      draperies, and with the streaming sunshine as a brilliant background
      behind him, stood the sable-clad figure of Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter VII: Premonition
    </h2>
    <p>
      Marguerite neither moved nor spoke. She felt two pairs of eyes fixed upon
      her, and with all the strength of will at her command she forced the very
      blood in her veins not to quit her cheeks, forced her eyelids not to
      betray by a single quiver the icy pang of a deadly premonition which at
      sight of Chauvelin seemed to have chilled her entire soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he stood before her, dressed in his usual somber garments, a look
      almost of humility in those keen grey eyes of his, which a year ago on the
      cliffs of Calais had peered down at her with such relentless hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that at this moment she should have felt an instinct of fear. What
      cause had she to throw more than a pitiful glance at the man who had tried
      so cruelly to wrong her, and who had so signally failed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Having bowed very low and very respectfully, Chauvelin advanced towards
      her, with all the airs of a disgraced courtier craving audience from his
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached she instinctively drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would you prefer not to speak to me, Lady Blakeney?” he said humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely believe her ears, or trust her eyes. It seemed
      impossible that a man could have so changed in a few months. He even
      looked shorter than last year, more shrunken within himself. His hair,
      which he wore free from powder, was perceptibly tinged with grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I withdraw?” he added after a pause, seeing that Marguerite made no
      movement to return his salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It would be best, perhaps,” she replied coldly. “You and I, Monsieur
      Chauvelin, have so little to say to one another.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Very little indeed,” he rejoined quietly; “the triumphant and happy have
      ever very little to say to the humiliated and the defeated. But I had
      hoped that Lady Blakeney in the midst of her victory would have spared one
      thought of pity and one of pardon.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I did not know that you had need of either from me, Monsieur.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Pity perhaps not, but forgiveness certainly.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You have that, if you so desire it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Since I failed, you might try to forget.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “That is beyond my power. But believe me, I have ceased to think of the
      infinite wrong which you tried to do to me.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But I failed,” he insisted, “and I meant no harm to YOU.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “To those I care for, Monsieur Chauvelin.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I had to serve my country as best I could. I meant no harm to your
      brother. He is safe in England now. And the Scarlet Pimpernel was nothing
      to you.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to read his face, tried to discover in those inscrutable eyes of
      his, some hidden meaning to his words. Instinct had warned her of course
      that this man could be nothing but an enemy, always and at all times. But
      he seemed so broken, so abject now, that contempt for his dejected
      attitude, and for the defeat which had been inflicted on him, chased the
      last remnant of fear from her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I did not even succeed in harming that enigmatical personage,” continued
      Chauvelin with the same self-abasement. “Sir Percy Blakeney, you remember,
      threw himself across my plans, quite innocently of course. I failed where
      you succeeded. Luck has deserted me. Our government offered me a humble
      post, away from France. I look after the interests of French subjects
      settled in England. My days of power are over. My failure is complete. I
      do not complain, for I failed in a combat of wits... but I failed... I
      failed... I failed... I am almost a fugitive and I am quite disgraced.
      That is my present history, Lady Blakeney,” he concluded, taking once more
      a step towards her, “and you will understand that it would be a solace if
      you extended your hand to me just once more, and let me feel that although
      you would never willingly look upon my face again, you have enough womanly
      tenderness in you to force your heart to forgiveness and mayhap to pity.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite hesitated. He held out his hand and her warm, impulsive nature
      prompted her to be kind. But instinct would not be gainsaid: a curious
      instinct to which she refused to respond. What had she to fear from this
      miserable and cringing little worm who had not even in him the pride of
      defeat? What harm could he do to her, or to those whom she loved? Her
      brother was in England! Her husband! Bah! not the enmity of the entire
      world could make her fear for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nay! That instinct, which caused her to draw away from Chauvelin, as she
      would from a venomous asp, was certainly not fear. It was hate! She hated
      this man! Hated him for all that she had suffered because of him; for that
      terrible night on the cliffs of Calais! The peril to her husband who had
      become so infinitely dear! The humiliations and self-reproaches which he
      had endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! it was hate! and hate was of all emotions the one she most despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hate? Does one hate a slimy but harmless toad or a stinging fly? It seemed
      ridiculous, contemptible and pitiable to think of hate in connection with
      the melancholy figure of this discomfited intriguer, this fallen leader of
      revolutionary France.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was holding out his hand to her. If she placed even the tips of her
      fingers upon it, she would be making the compact of mercy and forgiveness
      which he was asking of her. The woman Desiree Candeille roused within her
      the last lingering vestige of her slumbering wrath. False, theatrical and
      stagy—as Marguerite had originally suspected—she appeared to
      have been in league with Chauvelin to bring about this undesirable
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blakeney turned from one to another, trying to conceal her contempt
      beneath a mask of passionless indifference. Candeille was standing close
      by, looking obviously distressed and not a little puzzled. An instant's
      reflection was sufficient to convince Marguerite that the whilom actress
      of the Varietes Theatre was obviously ignorant of the events to which
      Chauvelin had been alluding: she was, therefore, of no serious
      consequence, a mere tool, mayhap, in the ex-ambassador's hands. At the
      present moment she looked like a silly child who does not understand the
      conversation of the “grown-ups.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite had promised her help and protection, had invited her to her
      house, and offered her a munificent gift in aid of a deserving cause. She
      was too proud to go back now on that promise, to rescind the contract
      because of an unexplainable fear. With regard to Chauvelin, the matter
      stood differently: she had made him no direct offer of hospitality: she
      had agreed to receive in her house the official chaperone of an
      unprotected girl, but she was not called upon to show cordiality to her
      own and her husband's most deadly enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ready to dismiss him out of her life with a cursory word of pardon
      and a half-expressed promise of oblivion: on that understanding and that
      only she was ready to let her hand rest for the space of one second in
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had looked upon her fallen enemy, seen his discomfiture and his
      humiliation! Very well! Now let him pass out of her life, all the more
      easily, since the last vision of him would be one of such utter abjection
      as would even be unworthy of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these thoughts, feelings and struggles passed through her mind with
      great rapidity. Her hesitation had lasted less than five seconds:
      Chauvelin still wore the look of doubting entreaty with which he had first
      begged permission to take her hand in his. With an impulsive toss of the
      head, she had turned straight towards him, ready with the phrase with
      which she meant to dismiss him from her sight now and forever, when
      suddenly a well-known laugh broke in upon her ear, and a lazy, drawly
      voice said pleasantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “La! I vow the air is fit to poison you! Your Royal Highness, I entreat,
      let us turn our backs upon these gates of Inferno, where lost souls would
      feel more at home than doth your humble servant.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales had entered the
      tent, closely followed by Sir Percy Blakeney.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter VIII: The Invitation
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in truth a strange situation, this chance meeting between Percy
      Blakeney and ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite looked up at her husband. She saw him shrug his broad shoulders
      as he first caught sight of Chauvelin, and glance down in his usual lazy,
      good-humoured manner at the shrunken figure of the silent Frenchman. The
      words she meant to say never crossed her lips; she was waiting to hear
      what the two men would say to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinct of the grande dame in her, the fashionable lady accustomed to
      the exigencies of society, just gave her sufficient presence of mind to
      make the requisite low curtsey before His Royal Highness. But the Prince,
      forgetting his accustomed gallantry, was also absorbed in the little scene
      before him. He, too, was looking from the sable-clad figure of Chauvelin
      to that of gorgeously arrayed Sir Percy. He, too, like Marguerite, was
      wondering what was passing behind the low, smooth forehead of that
      inimitable dandy, what behind the inscrutably good-humoured expression of
      those sleepy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the five persons thus present in the dark and stuffy booth, certainly
      Sir Percy Blakeney seemed the least perturbed. He had paused just long
      enough to allow Chauvelin to become fully conscious of a feeling of
      supreme irritation and annoyance, then he strolled up to the
      ex-ambassador, with hand outstretched and the most engaging of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ha!” he said, with his usual half-shy, half-pleasant-tempered smile, “my
      engaging friend from France! I hope, sir, that our demmed climate doth
      find you well and hearty to-day.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The cheerful voice seemed to ease the tension. Marguerite sighed a sigh of
      relief. After all, what was more natural than that Percy with his amazing
      fund of pleasant irresponsibility should thus greet the man who had once
      vowed to bring him to the guillotine? Chauvelin, himself, accustomed by
      now to the audacious coolness of his enemy, was scarcely taken by
      surprise. He bowed low to His Highness, who, vastly amused at Blakeney's
      sally, was inclined to be gracious to everyone, even though the
      personality of Chauvelin as a well-known leader of the regicide government
      was inherently distasteful to him. But the Prince saw in the wizened
      little figure before him an obvious butt for his friend Blakeney's
      impertinent shafts, and although historians have been unable to assert
      positively whether or no George Prince of Wales knew aught of Sir Percy's
      dual life, yet there is no doubt that he was always ready to enjoy a
      situation which brought about the discomfiture of any of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel's avowed enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I, too, have not met M. Chauvelin for many a long month,” said His Royal
      Highness with an obvious show of irony. “And I mistake not, sir, you left
      my father's court somewhat abruptly last year.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, your Royal Highness,” said Percy gaily, “my friend Monsieur... er...
      Chaubertin and I had serious business to discuss, which could only be
      dealt with in France.... Am I not right, Monsieur?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Quite right, Sir Percy,” replied Chauvelin curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We had to discuss abominable soup in Calais, had we not?” continued
      Blakeney in the same tone of easy banter, “and wine that I vowed was
      vinegar. Monsieur... er... Chaubertin... no, no, I beg pardon...
      Chauvelin... Monsieur Chauvelin and I quite agreed upon that point. The
      only matter on which we were not quite at one was the question of snuff.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Snuff?” laughed His Royal Highness, who seemed vastly amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, your Royal Highness... snuff... Monsieur Chauvelin here had—if
      I may be allowed to say so—so vitiated a taste in snuff that he
      prefers it with an admixture of pepper... Is that not so, Monsieur...
      er... Chaubertin?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Chauvelin, Sir Percy,” remarked the ex-ambassador drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was determined not to lose his temper and looked urbane and pleasant,
      whilst his impudent enemy was enjoying a joke at his expense. Marguerite
      the while had not taken her eyes off the keen, shrewd face. Whilst the
      three men talked, she seemed suddenly to have lost her sense of the
      reality of things. The present situation appeared to her strangely
      familiar, like a dream which she had dreamt oft times before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it became absolutely clear to her that the whole scene had been
      arranged and planned: the booth with its flaring placard, Demoiselle
      Candeille soliciting her patronage, her invitation to the young actress,
      Chauvelin's sudden appearance, all, all had been concocted and arranged,
      not here, not in England at all, but out there in Paris, in some dark
      gathering of blood-thirsty ruffians, who had invented a final trap for the
      destruction of the bold adventurer, who went by the name of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she also was only a puppet, enacting a part which had been written for
      her: she had acted just as THEY had anticipated, had spoken the very words
      they had meant her to say: and when she looked at Percy, he seemed
      supremely ignorant of it all, unconscious of this trap of the existence of
      which everyone here present was aware, save indeed himself. She would have
      fought against this weird feeling of obsession, of being a mechanical toy
      would up to do certain things, but this she could not do; her will
      appeared paralysed, her tongue even refused her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in a dream she heard His Royal Highness ask for the name of the young
      actress who was soliciting alms for the poor of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      That also had been prearranged. His Royal Highness for the moment was also
      a puppet, made to dance, to speak and to act as Chauvelin and his
      colleagues over in France had decided that he should. Quite mechanically
      Marguerite introduced Demoiselle Candeille to the Prince's gracious
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If your Highness will permit,” she said, “Mademoiselle Candeille will
      give us some of her charming old French songs at my rout to-morrow.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “By all means! By all means!” said the Prince. “I used to know some in my
      childhood days. Charming and poetic.... I know.... I know.... We shall be
      delighted to hear Mademoiselle sing, eh, Blakeney?” he added
      good-humouredly, “and for your rout to-morrow will you not also invite M.
      Chauvelin?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! but that goes without saying, your Royal Highness,” responded Sir
      Percy, with hospitable alacrity and a most approved bow directed at his
      arch-enemy. “We shall expect M. Chauvelin. He and I have not met for so
      long, and he shall be made right welcome at Blakeney Manor.”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter IX: Demoiselle Candeille
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her origin was of the humblest, for her mother—so it was said—had
      been kitchen-maid in the household of the Duc de Marny, but Desiree had
      received some kind of education, and though she began life as a dresser in
      one of the minor theatres of Paris, she became ultimately one of its most
      popular stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was small and dark, dainty in her manner and ways, and with a graceful
      little figure, peculiarly supple and sinuous. Her humble origin certainly
      did not betray itself in her hands and feet, which were exquisite in shape
      and lilliputian in size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair was soft and glossy, always free from powder, and cunningly
      arranged so as to slightly overshadow the upper part of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chin was small and round, the mouth extraordinarily red, the neck
      slender and long. But she was not pretty: so said all the women. Her skin
      was rather coarse in texture and darkish in colour, her eyes were narrow
      and slightly turned upwards at the corners; no! she was distinctly not
      pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she pleased the men! Perhaps because she was so artlessly determined
      to please them. The women said that Demoiselle Candeille never left a man
      alone until she had succeeded in captivating his fancy if only for five
      minutes; an interval in a dance... the time to cross a muddy road.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for five minutes she was determined to hold any man's complete
      attention, and to exact his admiration. And she nearly always succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the women hated her. The men were amused. It is extremely
      pleasant to have one's admiration compelled, one's attention so
      determinedly sought after.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Candeille could be extremely amusing, and as Magdelon in Moliere's “Les
      Precieuses” was quite inimitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, was in the olden days, just before Paris went quite mad,
      before the Reign of Terror had set in, and ci-devant Louis the King had
      been executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Candeille had taken it into her frolicsome little head that she would like
      to go to London. The idea was of course in the nature of an experiment.
      Those dull English people over the water knew so little of what good
      acting really meant. Tragedy? Well! passons! Their heavy, large-boned
      actresses might manage one or two big scenes where a commanding presence
      and a powerful voice would not come amiss, and where prominent teeth would
      pass unnoticed in the agony of a dramatic climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Comedy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! ca non, par example! Demoiselle Candeille had seen several English
      gentlemen and ladies in those same olden days at the Tuileries, but she
      really could not imagine any of them enacting the piquant scenes of
      Moliere or Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demoiselle Candeille thought of every English-born individual as having
      very large teeth. Now large teeth do not lend themselves to well-spoken
      comedy scenes, to smiles, or to double entendre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own teeth were exceptionally small and white, and very sharp, like
      those of a kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! Demoiselle Candeille thought it would be extremely interesting to go
      to London and to show to a nation of shopkeepers how daintily one can be
      amused in a theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Permission to depart from Paris was easy to obtain. In fact the fair lady
      had never really found it difficult to obtain anything she very much
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case she had plenty of friends in high places. Marat was still
      alive and a great lover of the theatre. Tallien was a personal admirer of
      hers, Deputy Dupont would do anything she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to act in London, at a theatre called Drury Lane. She wanted to
      play Moliere in England in French, and had already spoken with several of
      her colleagues, who were ready to join her. They would give public
      representations in aid of the starving population of France; there were
      plenty of Socialistic clubs in London quite Jacobin and Revolutionary in
      tendency: their members would give her full support.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would be serving her country and her countrymen and incidentally see
      something of the world, and amuse herself. She was bored in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she thought of Marguerite St. Just, once of the Maison Moliere, who
      had captivated an English milor of enormous wealth. Demoiselle Candeille
      had never been of the Maison Moliere; she had been the leading star of one
      of the minor—yet much-frequented—theatres of Paris, but she
      felt herself quite able and ready to captivate some other unattached
      milor, who would load her with English money and incidentally bestow an
      English name upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experiment, however, had not proved an unmitigated success. At first
      she and her company did obtain a few engagements at one or two of the
      minor theatres, to give representations of some of the French classical
      comedies in the original language.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these never quite became the fashion. The feeling against France and
      all her doings was far too keen in that very set, which Demoiselle
      Candeille had desired to captivate with her talents, to allow of the
      English jeunesse doree to flock and see Moliere played in French, by a
      French troupe, whilst Candeille's own compatriots resident in England had
      given her but scant support.
    </p>
    <p>
      One section of these—the aristocrats and emigres—looked upon
      the actress who was a friend of all the Jacobins in Paris as nothing
      better than canaille. They sedulously ignored her presence in this
      country, and snubbed her whenever they had an opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other section—chiefly consisting of agents and spies of the
      Revolutionary Government—she would gladly have ignored. They had at
      first made a constant demand on her purse, her talents and her time: then
      she grew tired of them, and felt more and more chary of being identified
      with a set which was in such ill-odour with that very same jeunesse doree
      whom Candeille had desired to please.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her own country she was and always had been a good republican: Marat
      had given her her first start in life by his violent praises of her talent
      in his widely-circulated paper; she had been associated in Paris with the
      whole coterie of artists and actors: every one of them republican to a
      man. But in London, although one might be snubbed by the emigres and
      aristocrats—it did not do to be mixed up with the sans-culotte
      journalists and pamphleteers who haunted the Socialistic clubs of the
      English capital, and who were the prime organizers of all those seditious
      gatherings and treasonable unions that caused Mr. Pitt and his colleagues
      so much trouble and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one, Desiree Candeille's comrades, male and female, who had
      accompanied her to England, returned to their own country. When war was
      declared, some of them were actually sent back under the provisions of the
      Aliens Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Desiree had stayed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her old friends in Paris had managed to advise her that she would not be
      very welcome there just now. The sans-culotte journalists of England, the
      agents and spies of the Revolutionary Government, had taken their revenge
      of the frequent snubs inflicted upon them by the young actress, and in
      those days the fact of being unwelcome in France was apt to have a more
      lurid and more dangerous significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Candeille did not dare return: at any rate not for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      She trusted to her own powers of intrigue, and her well-known
      fascinations, to re-conquer the friendship of the Jacobin clique, and she
      once more turned her attention to the affiliated Socialistic clubs of
      England. But between the proverbial two stools, Demoiselle Candeille soon
      came to the ground. Her machinations became known in official quarters,
      her connection with all the seditious clubs of London was soon bruited
      abroad, and one evening Desiree found herself confronted with a document
      addressed to her: “From the Office of His Majesty's Privy Seal,” wherein
      it was set forth that, pursuant to the statute 33 George III. cap. 5, she,
      Desiree Candeille, a French subject now resident in England, was required
      to leave this kingdom by order of His Majesty within seven days, and that
      in the event of the said Desiree Candeille refusing to comply with this
      order, she would be liable to commitment, brought to trial and sentenced
      to imprisonment for a month, and afterwards to removal within a limited
      time under pain of transportation for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meant that Demoiselle Candeille had exactly seven days in which to
      make complete her reconciliation with her former friends who now ruled
      Paris and France with a relentless and perpetually bloodstained hand. No
      wonder that during the night which followed the receipt of this momentous
      document, Demoiselle Candeille suffered gravely from insomnia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dared not go back to France, she was ordered out of England! What was
      to become of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just three days before the eventful afternoon of the Richmond
      Gala, and twenty-four hours after ex-Ambassador Chauvelin had landed in
      England. Candeille and Chauvelin had since then met at the “Cercle des
      Jacobins Francais” in Soho Street, and now fair Desiree found herself in
      lodgings in Richmond, the evening of the day following the Gala, feeling
      that her luck had not altogether deserted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One conversation with Citizen Chauvelin had brought the fickle jade back
      to Demoiselle Candeilles' service. Nay, more, the young actress saw before
      her visions of intrigue, of dramatic situations, of pleasant little bits
      of revenge;—all of which was meat and drink and air to breathe for
      Mademoiselle Desiree.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was to sing in one of the most fashionable salons in England: that was
      very pleasant. The Prince of Wales would hear and see her! that opened out
      a vista of delightful possibilities! And all she had to do was to act a
      part dictated to her by Citizen Chauvelin, to behave as he directed, to
      move in the way he wished! Well! that was easy enough, since the part
      which she would have to play was one peculiarly suited to her talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at herself critically in the glass. Her maid Fanchon—a
      little French waif picked up in the slums of Soho—helped to readjust
      a stray curl which had rebelled against the comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now for the necklace, Mademoiselle,” said Fanchon with suppressed
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had just arrived by messenger: a large morocco case, which now lay open
      on the dressing table, displaying its dazzling contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Candeille scarcely dared to touch it, and yet it was for her. Citizen
      Chauvelin had sent a note with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Citizeness Candeille will please accept this gift from the government of
      France in acknowledgment of useful services past and to come.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The note was signed with Robespierre's own name, followed by that of
      Citizen Chauvelin. The morocco case contained a necklace of diamonds worth
      the ransom of a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For useful services past and to come!” and there were promises of still
      further rewards, a complete pardon for all defalcations, a place within
      the charmed circle of the Comedie Francaise, a grand pageant and
      apotheosis with Citizeness Candeille impersonating the Goddess of Reason,
      in the midst of a grand national fete, and the acclamations of excited
      Paris: and all in exchange for the enactment of a part—simple and
      easy—outlined for her by Chauvelin!...
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange! how inexplicable! Candeille took the necklace up in her
      trembling fingers and gazed musingly at the priceless gems. She had seen
      the jewels before, long, long ago! round the neck of the Duchesse de
      Marny, in whose service her own mother had been. She—as a child—had
      often gazed at and admired the great lady, who seemed like a wonderful
      fairy from an altogether different world, to the poor little kitchen slut.
    </p>
    <p>
      How wonderful are the vagaries of fortune! Desiree Candeille, the
      kitchen-maid's daughter, now wearing her ex-mistress' jewels. She supposed
      that these had been confiscated when the last of the Marnys—the
      girl, Juliette—had escaped from France! confiscated and now sent to
      her—Candeille—as a reward or as a bribe!
    </p>
    <p>
      In either case they were welcome. The actress' vanity was soothed. She
      knew Juliette Marny was in England, and that she would meet her to-night
      at Lady Blakeney's. After the many snubs which she had endured from French
      aristocrats settled in England, the actress felt that she was about to
      enjoy an evening of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intrigue excited her. She did not quite know what schemes Chauvelin
      was aiming at, what ultimate end he had had in view when he commanded her
      services and taught her the part which he wished her to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the schemes were vast and the end mighty, she could not doubt. The
      reward she had received was proof enough of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Fanchon stood there in speechless admiration, whilst her mistress
      still fondly fingered the magnificent necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle will wear the diamond to-night?” she asked with evident
      anxiety: she would have been bitterly disappointed to have seen the
      beautiful thing once more relegated to its dark morocco case.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, Fanchon!” said Candeille with a sigh of great satisfaction; “see
      that they are fastened quite securely, my girl.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the necklace round her shapely neck and Fanchon looked to see that
      the clasp was quite secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the sound of loud knocking at the street door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is M. Chauvelin come to fetch me with the chaise. Am I quite ready,
      Fanchon?” asked Desiree Candeille.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh yes, Mademoiselle!” sighed the little maid; “and Mademoiselle looks
      very beautiful to-night.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Lady Blakeney is very beautiful too, Fanchon,” rejoined the actress
      naively, “but I wonder if she will wear anything as fine as the Marny
      necklace?”
     </p>
    <p>
      The knocking at the street door was repeated. Candeille took a final,
      satisfied survey of herself in the glass. She knew her part and felt that
      she had dressed well for it. She gave a final, affectionate little tap to
      the diamonds round her neck, took her cloak and hood from Fanchon, and was
      ready to go.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter X: Lady Blakeney's Rout
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are several accounts extant, in the fashionable chronicles of the
      time, of the gorgeous reception given that autumn by Lady Blakeney in her
      magnificent riverside home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had the spacious apartments of Blakeney Manor looked more
      resplendent than on this memorable occasion—memorable because of the
      events which brought the brilliant evening to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince of Wales had come over by water from Carlton House; the Royal
      Princesses came early, and all fashionable London was there, chattering
      and laughing, displaying elaborate gowns and priceless jewels, dancing,
      flirting, listening to the strains of the string band, or strolling
      listlessly in the gardens, where the late roses and clumps of heliotrope
      threw soft fragrance on the balmy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marguerite was nervous and agitated. Strive how she might, she could
      not throw off that foreboding of something evil to come, which had
      assailed her from the first moment when she met Chauvelin face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      That unaccountable feeling of unreality was still upon her, that sense
      that she, and the woman Candeille, Percy and even His Royal Highness were,
      for the time being, the actors in a play written and stage-managed by
      Chauvelin. The ex-ambassador's humility, his offers of friendship, his
      quietude under Sir Percy's good-humoured banter, everything was a sham.
      Marguerite knew it; her womanly instinct, her passionate love, all cried
      out to her in warning: but there was that in her husband's nature which
      rendered her powerless in the face of such dangers, as, she felt sure,
      were now threatening him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before her guests had begun to assemble, she had been alone with him
      for a few minutes. She had entered the room in which he sat, looking
      radiantly beautiful in a shimmering gown of white and silver, with
      diamonds in her golden hair and round her exquisite neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moments like this, when she was alone with him, were the joy of her life.
      Then and then only did she see him as he really was, with that wistful
      tenderness in his deep-set eyes, that occasional flash of passion from
      beneath the lazily-drooping lids. For a few minutes—seconds, mayhap—the
      spirit of the reckless adventurer was laid to rest, relegated into the
      furthermost background of his senses by the powerful emotions of the
      lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he would seize her in his arms, and hold her to him, with a strange
      longing to tear from out his heart all other thoughts, feelings and
      passions save those which made him a slave to her beauty and her smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy!” she whispered to him to-night when freeing herself from his
      embrace. She looked up at him, and for this one heavenly second felt him
      all her own. “Percy, you will do nothing rash, nothing foolhardy to-night.
      That man had planned all that took place yesterday. He hates you, and ...”
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment his face and attitude had changed, the heavy lids drooped over
      the eyes, the rigidity of the mouth relaxed, and that quaint, half-shy,
      half-inane smile played around the firm lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course he does, m'dear,” he said in his usual affected, drawly tones,
      “of course he does, but that is so demmed amusing. He does not really know
      what or how much he knows, or what I know.... In fact... er... we none of
      us know anything... just at present....”
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed lightly and carelessly, then deliberately readjusted the set of
      his lace tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy!” she said reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, m'dear.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Lately when you brought Deroulede and Juliette Marny to England... I
      endured agonies of anxiety... and...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, a quick, short, wistful sigh, and said very gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know you did, m'dear, and that is where the trouble lies. I know that
      you are fretting, so I have to be so demmed quick about the business, so
      as not to keep you in suspense too long.... And now I can't take Ffoulkes
      away from his young wife, and Tony and the others are so mighty slow.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Percy!” she said once more with tender earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know, I know,” he said with a slight frown of self-reproach. “La! but I
      don't deserve your solicitude. Heavens know what a brute I was for years,
      whilst I neglected you, and ignored the noble devotion which I, alas! do
      even now so little to deserve.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She would have said something more, but was interrupted by the entrance of
      Juliette Marny into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Some of your guests have arrived, Lady Blakeney,” said the young girl,
      apologising for her seeming intrusion. “I thought you would wish to know.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliette looked very young and girlish in a simple white gown, without a
      single jewel on her arms or neck. Marguerite regarded her with unaffected
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You look charming to-night, Mademoiselle, does she not, Sir Percy?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Thanks to your bounty,” smiled Juliette, a trifle sadly. “Whilst I
      dressed to-night, I felt how I should have loved to wear my dear mother's
      jewels, of which she used to be so proud.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “We must hope that you will recover them, dear, some day,” said Marguerite
      vaguely, as she led the young girl out of the small study towards the
      larger reception rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed I hope so,” sighed Juliette. “When times became so troublous in
      France after my dear father's death, his confessor and friend, the Abbe
      Foucquet, took charge of all my mother's jewels for me. He said they would
      be safe with the ornaments of his own little church at Boulogne. He feared
      no sacrilege, and thought they would be most effectually hidden there, for
      no one would dream of looking for the Marny diamonds in the crypt of a
      country church.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite said nothing in reply. Whatever her own doubts might be upon
      such a subject, it could serve no purpose to disturb the young girl's
      serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Abbe Foucquet,” said Juliette after a while, “his is the kind of
      devotion which I feel sure will never be found under the new regimes of
      anarchy and of so-called equality. He would have laid down his life for my
      father or for me. And I know that he would never part with the jewels
      which I entrusted to his care, whilst he had breath and strength to defend
      them.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite would have wished to pursue the subject a little further. It
      was very pathetic to witness poor Juliette's hopes and confidences, which
      she felt sure would never be realised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Blakeney knew so much of what was going on in France just now:
      spoliations, confiscations, official thefts, open robberies, all in the
      name of equality, of fraternity and of patriotism. She knew nothing, of
      course, of the Abbe Foucquet, but the tender little picture of the devoted
      old man, painted by Juliette's words, had appealed strongly to her
      sympathetic heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinct and knowledge of the political aspect of France told her that by
      entrusting valuable family jewels to the old Abbe, Juliette had most
      unwittingly placed the man she so much trusted in danger of persecution at
      the hands of a government which did not even admit the legality of family
      possessions. However, there was neither time nor opportunity now to
      enlarge upon the subject. Marguerite resolved to recur to it a little
      later, when she would be alone with Mlle. de Marny, and above all when she
      could take counsel with her husband as to the best means of recovering the
      young girl's property for her, whilst relieving a devoted old man from the
      dangerous responsibility which he had so selflessly undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile the two women had reached the first of the long line of
      state apartments wherein the brilliant fete was to take place. The
      staircase and the hall below were already filled with the early arrivals.
      Bidding Juliette to remain in the ballroom, Lady Blakeney now took up her
      stand on the exquisitely decorated landing, ready to greet her guests. She
      had a smile and a pleasant word for all, as, in a constant stream, the
      elite of London fashionable society began to file past her, exchanging the
      elaborate greetings which the stilted mode of the day prescribed to this
      butterfly-world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lacqueys in the hall shouted the names of the guests as they passed up
      the stairs: names celebrated in politics, in worlds of sport, of science
      or of art, great historic names, humble, newly-made ones, noble
      illustrious titles. The spacious rooms were filling fast. His Royal
      Highness, so 'twas said, had just stepped out of his barge. The noise of
      laughter and chatter was incessant, like unto a crowd of gaily-plumaged
      birds. Huge bunches of apricot-coloured roses in silver vases made the air
      heavy with their subtle perfume. Fans began to flutter. The string band
      struck the preliminary cords of the gavotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the lacqueys at the foot of the stairs called out in
      stentorian tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille! and Monsieur Chauvelin!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite's heart gave a slight flutter; she felt a sudden tightening of
      the throat. She did not see Candeille at first, only the slight figure of
      Chauvelin dressed all in black, as usual, with head bent and hands clasped
      behind his back; he was slowly mounting the wide staircase, between a
      double row of brilliantly attired men and women, who looked with no small
      measure of curiosity at the ex-ambassador from revolutionary France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demoiselle Candeille was leading the way up the stairs. She paused on the
      landing in order to make before her hostess a most perfect and most
      elaborate curtsey. She looked smiling and radiant, beautifully dressed, a
      small wreath of wrought gold leaves in her hair, her only jewel an
      absolutely regal one, a magnificent necklace of diamonds round her shapely
      throat.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XI: The Challenge
    </h2>
    <p>
      It all occurred just before midnight, in one of the smaller rooms, which
      lead in enfilade from the principal ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dancing had been going on for some time, but the evening was close, and
      there seemed to be a growing desire on the part of Lady Blakeney's guests
      to wander desultorily through the gardens and glasshouses, or sit about
      where some measure of coolness could be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rumour that a new and charming French artiste was to sing a
      few peculiarly ravishing songs, unheard in England before. Close to the
      main ballroom was the octagon music-room which was brilliantly
      illuminated, and in which a large number of chairs had been obviously
      disposed for the comfort of an audience. Into this room many of the guests
      had already assembled. It was quite clear that a chamber-concert—select
      and attractive as were all Lady Blakeney's entertainments—was in
      contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite herself, released for a moment from her constant duties near
      her royal guests, had strolled through the smaller rooms, accompanied by
      Juliette, in order to search for Mademoiselle Candeille and to suggest the
      commencement of the improvised concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree Candeille had kept herself very much aloof throughout the evening,
      only talking to the one or two gentlemen whom her hostess had presented to
      her on her arrival, and with M. Chauvelin always in close attendance upon
      her every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, when dancing began, she retired to a small boudoir, and there
      sat down, demurely waiting, until Lady Blakeney should require her
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marguerite and Juliette Marny entered the little room, she rose and
      came forward a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am ready, Madame,” she said pleasantly, “whenever you wish me to begin.
      I have thought out a short programme,—shall I start with the gay or
      the sentimental songs?”
     </p>
    <p>
      But before Marguerite had time to utter a reply, she felt her arm
      nervously clutched by a hot and trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who... who is this woman?” murmured Juliette Marny close to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked pale and very agitated, and her large eyes were
      fixed in unmistakable wrath upon the French actress before her. A little
      startled, not understanding Juliette's attitude, Marguerite tried to reply
      lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is Mademoiselle Candeille, Juliette dear,” she said, affecting the
      usual formal introduction, “of the Varietes Theatre of Paris—Mademoiselle
      Desiree Candeille, who will sing some charming French ditties for us
      to-night.”
     </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke she kept a restraining hand on Juliette's quivering arm.
      Already, with the keen intuition which had been on the qui-vive the whole
      evening, she scented some mystery in this sudden outburst on the part of
      her young protegee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Juliette did not heed her: she felt surging up in her young,
      overburdened heart all the wrath and the contempt of the persecuted,
      fugitive aristocrat against the triumphant usurper. She had suffered so
      much from that particular class of the risen kitchen-wench of which the
      woman before her was so typical an example: years of sorrow, of poverty
      were behind her: loss of fortune, of kindred, of friends—she, even
      now a pauper, living on the bounty of strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this through no fault of her own: the fault of her class mayhap!
      but not hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had suffered much, and was still overwrought and nerve-strung: for
      some reason she could not afterwards have explained, she felt spiteful and
      uncontrolled, goaded into stupid fury by the look of insolence and of
      triumph with which Candeille calmly regarded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards she would willingly have bitten out her tongue for her
      vehemence, but for the moment she was absolutely incapable of checking the
      torrent of her own emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle Candeille, indeed?” she said in wrathful scorn, “Desiree
      Candeille, you mean, Lady Blakeney! my mother's kitchen-maid, flaunting
      shamelessly my dear mother's jewels which she has stolen mayhap...”
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl was trembling from head to foot, tears of anger obscured
      her eyes; her voice, which fortunately remained low—not much above a
      whisper—was thick and husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Juliette! Juliette! I entreat you,” admonished Marguerite, “you must
      control yourself, you must, indeed you must. Mademoiselle Candeille, I beg
      of you to retire....”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Candeille—well-schooled in the part she had to play—had no
      intention of quitting the field of battle. The more wrathful and excited
      Mademoiselle de Marny became the more insolent and triumphant waxed the
      young actress' whole attitude. An ironical smile played round the corners
      of her mouth, her almond-shaped eyes were half-closed, regarding through
      dropping lashes the trembling figure of the young impoverished aristocrat.
      Her head was thrown well back, in obvious defiance of the social
      conventions, which should have forbidden a fracas in Lady Blakeney's
      hospitable house, and her fingers provocatively toyed with the diamond
      necklace which glittered and sparkled round her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no need to repeat the words of a well-learnt part: her own wit,
      her own emotions and feelings helped her to act just as her employer would
      have wished her to do. Her native vulgarity helped her to assume the very
      bearing which he would have desired. In fact, at this moment Desiree
      Candeille had forgotten everything save the immediate present: a more than
      contemptuous snub from one of those penniless aristocrats, who had
      rendered her own sojourn in London so unpleasant and unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had suffered from these snubs before, but had never had the chance of
      forcing an esclandre, as a result of her own humiliation. That spirit of
      hatred for the rich and idle classes, which was so characteristic of
      revolutionary France, was alive and hot within her: she had never had an
      opportunity—she, the humble fugitive actress from a minor Paris
      theatre—to retort with forcible taunts to the ironical remarks made
      at and before her by the various poverty-stricken but haughty emigres who
      swarmed in those very same circles of London society into which she
      herself had vainly striven to penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at last, one of this same hated class, provoked beyond self-control,
      was allowing childish and unreasoning fury to outstrip the usual calm
      irony of aristocratic rebuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette had paused awhile, in order to check the wrathful tears which,
      much against her will, were choking the words in her throat and blinding
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hoity! toity!” laughed Candeille, “hark at the young baggage!”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Juliette had turned to Marguerite and began explaining volubly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “My mother's jewels!” she said in the midst of her tears, “ask her how she
      came by them. When I was obliged to leave the home of my fathers,—stolen
      from me by the Revolutionary Government—I contrived to retain my
      mother's jewels... you remember, I told you just now.... The Abbe Foucquet—dear
      old man! Saved them for me... that and a little money which I had... he
      took charge of them... he said he would place them in safety with the
      ornaments of his church, and now I see them round that woman's neck... I
      know that he would not have parted with them save with his life.”
     </p>
    <p>
      All the while that the young girl spoke in a voice half-choked with sobs,
      Marguerite tried with all the physical and mental will at her command to
      drag her out of the room and thus to put a summary ending to this
      unpleasant scene. She ought to have felt angry with Juliette for this
      childish and senseless outburst, were it not for the fact that somehow she
      knew within her innermost heart that all this had been arranged and
      preordained: not by Fate—not by a Higher Hand, but by the most
      skilful intriguer present-day France had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even now, as she was half succeeding in turning Juliette away from the
      sight of Candeille, she was not the least surprised or startled at seeing
      Chauvelin standing in the very doorway through which she had hoped to
      pass. One glance at his face had made her fears tangible and real: there
      was a look of satisfaction and triumph in his pale, narrow eyes, a flash
      in them of approbation directed at the insolent attitude of the French
      actress: he looked like the stage-manager of a play, content with the
      effect his own well-arranged scenes were producing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he hoped to gain by this—somewhat vulgar—quarrel between
      the two women, Marguerite of course could not guess: that something was
      lurking in his mind, inimical to herself and to her husband, she did not
      for a moment doubt, and at this moment she felt that she would have given
      her very life to induce Candeille and Juliette to cease this passage of
      arms, without further provocation on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Juliette might have been ready to yield to Lady Blakeney's
      persuasion, Desiree Candeille, under Chauvelin's eye, and fired by her own
      desire to further humiliate this overbearing aristocrat, did not wish the
      little scene to end so tamely just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your old calotin was made to part with his booty, m'dear,” she said, with
      a contemptuous shrug of her bare shoulders. “Paris and France have been
      starving these many years past: a paternal government seized all it could
      with which to reward those that served it well, whilst all that would have
      been brought, bread and meat for the poor, was being greedily stowed away by
      shameless traitors!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Juliette winced at the insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” she moaned, as she buried her flaming face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late now did she realise that she had deliberately stirred up a
      mud-heap and sent noisome insects buzzing about her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mademoiselle,” said Marguerite authoritatively, “I must ask you to
      remember that Mlle. de Marny is my friend and that you are a guest in my
      house.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! I try not to forget it,” rejoined Candeille lightly, “but of a truth
      you must admit, Citizeness, that it would require the patience of a saint
      to put up with the insolence of a penniless baggage, who but lately has
      had to stand her trial in her own country for impurity of conduct.”
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, whilst Marguerite distinctly heard a short
      sigh of satisfaction escaping from the lips of Chauvelin. Then a pleasant
      laugh broke upon the ears of the four actors who were enacting the
      dramatic little scene, and Sir Percy Blakeney, immaculate in his rich
      white satin coat and filmy lace ruffles, exquisite in manners and
      courtesy, entered the little boudoir, and with his long back slightly
      bent, his arm outstretched in a graceful and well-studied curve, he
      approached Mademoiselle Desiree Candeille.
    </p>
    <p>
      “May I have the honour,” he said with his most elaborate air of courtly
      deference, “of conducting Mademoiselle to her chaise?”
     </p>
    <p>
      In the doorway just behind him stood His Royal Highness the Prince of
      Wales chatting with apparent carelessness to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord
      Anthony Dewhurst. A curtain beyond the open door was partially drawn
      aside, disclosing one or two brilliantly dressed groups, strolling
      desultorily through the further rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four persons assembled in the little boudoir had been so absorbed by
      their own passionate emotions and the violence of their quarrel that they
      had not noticed the approach of Sir Percy Blakeney and of his friends.
      Juliette and Marguerite certainly were startled and Candeille was
      evidently taken unawares. Chauvelin alone seemed quite indifferent and
      stood back a little when Sir Percy advanced, in order to allow him to
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Candeille recovered quickly enough from her surprise: without heeding
      Blakeney's proffered arm, she turned with all the airs of an insulted
      tragedy queen towards Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So 'tis I,” she said with affected calm, “who am to bear every insult in
      a house in which I was bidden as a guest. I am turned out like some
      intrusive and importunate beggar, and I, the stranger in this land, am
      destined to find that amidst all these brilliant English gentlemen there
      is not one man of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      “M. Chauvelin,” she added loudly, “our beautiful country has, meseems,
      deputed you to guard the honour as well as the worldly goods of your
      unprotected compatriots. I call upon you, in the name of France, to avenge
      the insults offered to me to-night.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round defiantly from one to the other of the several faces
      which were now turned towards her, but no one, for the moment, spoke or
      stirred. Juliette, silent and ashamed, had taken Marguerite's hand in
      hers, and was clinging to it as if wishing to draw strength of character
      and firmness of purpose through the pores of the other woman's delicate
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy with backbone still bent in a sweeping curve had not relaxed his
      attitude of uttermost deference. The Prince of Wales and his friends were
      viewing the scene with slightly amused aloofness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment—seconds at most—there was dead silence in the
      room, during which time it almost seemed as if the beating of several
      hearts could be distinctly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Chauvelin, courtly and urbane, stepped calmly forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Believe me, Citizeness,” he said, addressing Candeille directly and with
      marked emphasis, “I am entirely at your command, but am I not helpless,
      seeing that those who have so grossly insulted you are of your own
      irresponsible, if charming, sex?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a great dog after a nap, Sir Percy Blakeney straightened his long
      back and stretched it out to its full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      “La!” he said pleasantly, “my ever engaging friend from Calais. Sir, your
      servant. Meseems we are ever destined to discuss amiable matters, in an
      amiable spirit.... A glass of punch, Monsieur... er... Chauvelin?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I must ask you, Sir Percy,” rejoined Chauvelin sternly, “to view this
      matter with becoming seriousness.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Seriousness is never becoming, sir,” said Blakeney, politely smothering a
      slight yawn, “and it is vastly unbecoming in the presence of ladies.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Am I to understand then, Sir Percy,” said Chauvelin, “that you are
      prepared to apologize to Mademoiselle Candeille for this insult offered to
      her by Lady Blakeney?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy again tried to smother that tiresome little yawn, which seemed
      most distressing, when he desired to be most polite. Then he flicked off a
      grain of dust from his immaculate lace ruffle and buried his long, slender
      hands in the capacious pockets of his white satin breeches; finally he
      said with the most good-natured of smiles:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sir, have you seen the latest fashion in cravats? I would wish to draw
      your attention to the novel way in which we in England tie a Mechlin-edged
      bow.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir Percy,” retorted Chauvelin firmly, “since you will not offer
      Mademoiselle Candeille the apology which she has the right to expect from
      you, are you prepared that you and I should cross swords like honourable
      gentlemen?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Blakeney laughed his usual pleasant, somewhat shy laugh, shook his
      powerful frame and looked from his altitude of six feet three inches down
      on the small, sable-clad figure of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The question is, sir,” he said slowly, “should we then be two honourable
      gentlemen crossing swords?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir Percy...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin, who for one moment had seemed ready to lose his temper, now
      made a sudden effort to resume a calm and easy attitude and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course, if one of us is coward enough to shirk the contest...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not complete the sentence, but shrugged his shoulders expressive of
      contempt. The other side of the curtained doorway a little crowd had
      gradually assembled, attracted hither by the loud and angry voices which
      came from that small boudoir. Host and hostess had been missed from the
      reception rooms for some time, His Royal Highness, too, had not been seen
      for the quarter of an hour: like flies attracted by the light, one by one,
      or in small isolated groups, some of Lady Blakeney's guests had found
      their way to the room adjoining the royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As His Highness was standing in the doorway itself, no one could of course
      cross the threshold, but everyone could see into the room, and could take
      stock of the various actors in the little comedy. They were witnessing a
      quarrel between the French envoy and Sir Percy Blakeney wherein the former
      was evidently in deadly earnest and the latter merely politely bored.
      Amused comments flew to and fro: laughter and a babel of irresponsible
      chatter made an incessant chirruping accompaniment to the duologue between
      the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this stage, the Prince of Wales, who hitherto had seemingly kept
      aloof from the quarrel, suddenly stepped forward and abruptly interposed
      the weight of his authority and of his social position between the
      bickering adversaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tush, man!” he said impatiently, turning more especially towards
      Chauvelin, “you talk at random. Sir Percy Blakeney is an English
      gentleman, and the laws of this country do not admit of duelling, as you
      understand it in France; and I for one certainly could not allow...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Pardon, your Royal Highness,” interrupted Sir Percy with irresistible
      bonhomie, “your Highness does not understand the situation. My engaging
      friend here does not propose that I should transgress the laws of this
      country, but that I should go over to France with him, and fight him
      there, where duelling and... er... other little matters of that sort are
      allowed.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! quite so!” rejoined the Prince, “I understand M. Chauvelin's desire.
      ... But what about you, Blakeney?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” replied Sir Percy lightly, “I have accepted his challenge, of
      course!”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XII: Time—Place—Conditions
    </h2>
    <p>
      It would be very difficult indeed to say why—at Blakeney's lightly
      spoken words—an immediate silence should have fallen upon all those
      present. All the actors in the little drawing-room drama, who had played
      their respective parts so unerringly up to now, had paused a while, just
      as if an invisible curtain had come down, marking the end of a scene, and
      the interval during which the players might recover strength and energy to
      resume their roles. The Prince of Wales as foremost spectator said nothing
      for the moment, and beyond the doorway, the audience there assembled
      seemed suddenly to be holding its breath, waiting—eager, expectant,
      palpitation—for what would follow now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only here and there the gentle frou-frou of a silk skirt, the rhythmic
      flutter of a fan, broke those few seconds' deadly, stony silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was all simple enough. A fracas between two ladies, the gentlemen
      interposing, a few words of angry expostulation, then the inevitable
      suggestion of Belgium or of some other country where the childish and
      barbarous custom of settling such matters with a couple of swords had not
      been as yet systematically stamped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene—with but slight variations—had occurred scores
      of times in London drawing-rooms, English gentlemen had scores of times
      crossed the Channel for the purpose of settling similar quarrels in
      continental fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should the present situation appear so abnormal? Sir Percy Blakeney—an
      accomplished gentleman—was past master in the art of fence, and
      looked more than a match in strength and dexterity for the meagre,
      sable-clad little opponent who had so summarily challenged him to cross
      over to France, in order to fight a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow everyone had a feeling at this moment that this proposed duel
      would be unlike any other combat ever fought between two antagonists.
      Perhaps it was the white, absolutely stony and unexpressive face of
      Marguerite which suggested a latent tragedy: perhaps it was the look of
      unmistakable horror in Juliette's eyes, or that of triumph in those of
      Chauvelin, or even that certain something in His Royal Highness' face,
      which seemed to imply that the Prince, careless man of the world as he
      was, would have given much to prevent this particular meeting from taking
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, there is no doubt that a certain wave of electrical
      excitement swept over the little crowd assembled there, the while the
      chief actor in the little drama, the inimitable dandy, Sir Percy Blakeney
      himself, appeared deeply engrossed in removing a speck of powder from the
      wide black satin ribbon which held his gold-rimmed eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gentlemen!” said His Royal Highness suddenly, “we are forgetting the
      ladies. My lord Hastings,” he added, turning to one of the gentlemen who
      stood close to him, “I pray you to remedy this unpardonable neglect. Men's
      quarrels are not fit for ladies' dainty ears.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy looked up from his absorbing occupation. His eyes met those of
      his wife; she was like a marble statue, hardly conscious of what was going
      on round her. But he, who knew every emotion which swayed that ardent and
      passionate nature, guessed that beneath that stony calm there lay a mad,
      almost unconquerable impulse: and that was to shout to all these puppets
      here, the truth, the awful, the unanswerable truth, to tell them what this
      challenge really meant; a trap wherein one man consumed with hatred and
      desire for revenge hoped to entice a brave and fearless foe into a
      death-dealing snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full well did Percy Blakeney guess that for the space of one second his
      most cherished secret hovered upon his wife's lips, one turn of the
      balance of Fate, one breath from the mouth of an unseen sprite, and
      Marguerite was ready to shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not allow this monstrous thing to be! The Scarlet Pimpernel, whom you
      all admire for his bravery, and love for his daring, stands before you
      now, face to face with his deadliest enemy, who is here to lure him to his
      doom!”
     </p>
    <p>
      For that momentous second therefore Percy Blakeney held his wife's gaze
      with the magnetism of his own; all there was in him of love, of entreaty,
      of trust, and of command went out to her through that look with which he
      kept her eyes riveted upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw the rigidity of her attitude relax. She closed her eyes in
      order to shut out the whole world from her suffering soul. She seemed to
      be gathering all the mental force of which her brain was capable, for one
      great effort of self-control. Then she took Juliette's hand in hers, and
      turned to go out of the room; the gentlemen bowed as she swept past them,
      her rich silken gown making a soft hush-sh-sh as she went. She nodded to
      some, curtseyed to the Prince, and had at the last moment the supreme
      courage and pride to turn her head once more towards her husband, in order
      to reassure him finally that his secret was as safe with her now, in this
      hour of danger, as it had been in the time of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and passed out of his sight, preceded by Desiree Candeille,
      who, escorted by one of the gentlemen, had become singularly silent and
      subdued.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little room now there only remained a few men. Sir Andrew Ffoulkes
      had taken the precaution of closing the door after the ladies had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then His Royal Highness turned once more to Monsieur Chauvelin and said
      with an obvious show of indifference:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Faith, Monsieur! meseems we are all enacting a farce, which can have no
      final act. I vow that I cannot allow my friend Blakeney to go over to
      France at your bidding. Your government now will not allow my father's
      subjects to land on your shores without a special passport, and then only
      for a specific purpose.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “La, your Royal Highness,” interposed Sir Percy, “I pray you have no fear
      for me on that score. My engaging friend here has—an I mistake not—a
      passport ready for me in the pocket of his sable-hued coat, and as we are
      hoping effectually to spit one another over there... gadzooks! but there's
      the specific purpose.... Is it not true, sir,” he added, turning once more
      to Chauvelin, “that in the pocket of that exquisitely cut coat of yours,
      you have a passport—name in blank perhaps—which you had
      specially designed for me?”
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so carelessly, so pleasantly said, that no one save Chauvelin
      guessed the real import of Sir Percy's words. Chauvelin, of course, knew
      their inner meaning: he understood that Blakeney wished to convey to him
      the fact that he was well aware that the whole scene to-night had been
      prearranged, and that it was willingly and with eyes wide open that he
      walked into the trap which the revolutionary patriot had so carefully laid
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The passport will be forthcoming in due course, sir,” retorted Chauvelin
      evasively, “when our seconds have arranged all formalities.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Seconds be demmed, sir,” rejoined Sir Percy placidly, “you do not
      propose, I trust, that we travel a whole caravan to France.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Time, place and conditions must be settled, Sir Percy,” replied
      Chauvelin; “you are too accomplished a cavalier, I feel sure, to wish to
      arrange such formalities yourself.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! neither you nor I, Monsieur... er... Chauvelin,” quoth Sir Percy
      blandly, “could, I own, settle such things with persistent good-humour;
      and good-humour in such cases is the most important of all formalities. Is
      it not so?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, Sir Percy.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “As for seconds? Perish the thought. One second only, I entreat, and that
      one a lady—the most adorable—the most detestable—the
      most true—the most fickle amidst all her charming sex.... Do you
      agree, sir?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You have not told me her name, Sir Percy?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Chance, Monsieur, Chance.... With His Royal Highness' permission let the
      wilful jade decide.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Three throws of the dice, Monsieur.... Time... Place... Conditions, you
      said—three throws and the winner names them.... Do you agree?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin hesitated. Sir Percy's bantering mood did not quite fit in with
      his own elaborate plans, moreover the ex-ambassador feared a pitfall of
      some sort, and did not quite like to trust to this arbitration of the
      dice-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, quite involuntarily, in appeal to the Prince of Wales and the
      other gentlemen present.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Englishman of those days was a born gambler. He lived with the
      dice-box in one pocket and a pack of cards in the other. The Prince
      himself was no exception to this rule, and the first gentleman in England
      was the most avowed worshipper of Hazard in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chance, by all means,” quoth His Highness gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Chance! Chance!” repeated the others eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of so hostile a crowd, Chauvelin felt it unwise to resist.
      Moreover, one second's reflection had already assured him that this
      throwing of the dice could not seriously interfere with the success of his
      plans. If the meeting took place at all—and Sir Percy now had gone
      too far to draw back—then of necessity it would have to take place
      in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of time and conditions of the fight, which at best would be
      only a farce—only a means to an end—could not be of paramount
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore he shrugged his shoulders with well-marked indifference, and
      said lightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you please.”
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a small table in the centre of the room with a settee and two or
      three chairs arranged close to it. Around this table now an eager little
      group had congregated: the Prince of Wales in the forefront, unwilling to
      interfere, scarce knowing what madcap plans were floating through
      Blakeney's adventurous brain, but excited in spite of himself at this
      momentous game of hazard the issues of which seemed so nebulous, so
      vaguely fraught with dangers. Close to him were Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, Lord
      Anthony Dewhurst, Lord Grenville and perhaps a half score gentlemen, young
      men about town mostly, gay and giddy butterflies of fashion, who did not
      even attempt to seek in this strange game of chance any hidden meaning
      save that it was one of Blakeney's irresponsible pranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the centre of the compact group, Sir Percy Blakeney in his gorgeous
      suit of shimmering white satin, one knee bent upon a chair, and leaning
      with easy grace—dice-box in hand—across the small gilt-legged
      table; beside him ex-Ambassador Chauvelin, standing with arms folded
      behind his back, watching every movement of his brilliant adversary like
      some dark-plumaged hawk hovering near a bird of paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Place first, Monsieur?” suggested Sir Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you will, sir,” assented Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up a dice-box which one of the gentlemen handed to him and the two
      men threw.
    </p>
    <p>
      “'Tis mine, Monsieur,” said Blakeney carelessly, “mine to name the place
      where shall occur this historic encounter, 'twixt the busiest man in
      France and the most idle fop that e'er disgraced these three kingdoms....
      Just for the sake of argument, sir, what place would you suggest?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! the exact spot is immaterial, Sir Percy,” replied Chauvelin coldly,
      “the whole of France stands at your disposal.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! I thought as much, but could not be quite sure of such boundless
      hospitality,” retorted Blakeney imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you care for the woods around Paris, sir?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Too far from the coast, sir. I might be sea-sick crossing over the
      Channel, and glad to get the business over as soon as possible.... No, not
      Paris, sir—rather let us say Boulogne.... Pretty little place,
      Boulogne... do you not think so...?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly, Sir Percy.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then Boulogne it is... the ramparts, an you will, on the south side of the
      town.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “As you please,” rejoined Chauvelin drily. “Shall we throw again?”
     </p>
    <p>
      A murmur of merriment had accompanied this brief colloquy between the
      adversaries, and Blakeney's bland sallies were received with shouts of
      laughter. Now the dice rattled again and once more the two men threw.
    </p>
    <p>
      “'Tis yours this time, Monsieur Chauvelin,” said Blakeney, after a rapid
      glance at the dice. “See how evenly Chance favours us both. Mine, the
      choice of place... admirably done you'll confess.... Now yours the choice
      of time. I wait upon your pleasure, sir.... The southern ramparts at
      Boulogne—when?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “The fourth day from this, sir, at the hour when the Cathedral bell chimes
      the evening Angelus,” came Chauvelin's ready reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! but methought that your demmed government had abolished Cathedrals,
      and bells and chimes.... The people of France have now to go to hell their
      own way... for the way to heaven has been barred by the National
      Convention.... Is that not so?... Methought the Angelus was forbidden to
      be rung.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Not at Boulogne, I think, Sir Percy,” retorted Chauvelin drily, “and I'll
      pledge you my word that the evening Angelus shall be rung that night.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “At what hour is that, sir?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “One hour after sundown.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But why four days after this? Why not two or three?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I might have asked, why the southern ramparts, Sir Percy; why not the
      western? I chose the fourth day—does it not suit you?” asked
      Chauvelin ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Suit me! Why, sir, nothing could suit me better,” rejoined Blakeney with
      his pleasant laugh. “Zounds! but I call it marvellous... demmed
      marvellous... I wonder now,” he added blandly, “what made you think of the
      Angelus?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone laughed at this, a little irrelevantly perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” continued Blakeney gaily, “I remember now.... Faith! to think that I
      was nigh forgetting that when last you and I met, sir, you had just taken
      or were about to take Holy Orders.... Ah! how well the thought of the
      Angelus fits in with your clerical garb.... I recollect that the latter
      was mightily becoming to you, sir...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we proceed to settle the conditions of the fight, Sir Percy?” said
      Chauvelin, interrupting the flow of his antagonist's gibes, and trying to
      disguise his irritation beneath a mask of impassive reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The choice of weapons you mean,” here interposed His Royal Highness, “but
      I thought that swords had already been decided on.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Quite so, your Highness,” assented Blakeney, “but there are various
      little matters in connection with this momentous encounter which are of
      vast importance.... Am I not right, Monsieur?... Gentlemen, I appeal to
      you.... Faith! one never knows... my engaging opponent here might desire
      that I should fight him in green socks, and I that he should wear a
      scarlet flower in his coat.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “The Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why not, Monsieur? It would look so well in your buttonhole, against the
      black of the clerical coat, which I understand you sometime affect in
      France... and when it is withered and quite dead you would find that it
      would leave an overpowering odour in your nostrils, far stronger than that
      of incense.”
     </p>
    <p>
      There was general laughter after this. The hatred which every member of
      the French revolutionary government—including, of course,
      ex-Ambassador Chauvelin—bore to the national hero was well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The conditions then, Sir Percy,” said Chauvelin, without seeming to
      notice the taunt conveyed in Blakeney's last words. “Shall we throw
      again?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “After you, sir,” acquiesced Sir Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the third and last time the two opponents rattled the dice-box and
      threw. Chauvelin was now absolutely unmoved. These minor details quite
      failed to interest him. What mattered the conditions of the fight which
      was only intended as a bait with which to lure his enemy in the open? The
      hour and place were decided on and Sir Percy would not fail to come.
      Chauvelin knew enough of his opponent's boldly adventurous spirit not to
      feel in the least doubtful on that point. Even now, as he gazed with
      grudging admiration at the massive, well-knit figure of his arch-enemy,
      noted the thin nervy hands and square jaw, the low, broad forehead and
      deep-set, half-veiled eyes, he knew that in this matter wherein Percy
      Blakeney was obviously playing with his very life, the only emotion that
      really swayed him at this moment was his passionate love of adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruling passion strong in death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! Sir Percy would be on the southern ramparts of Boulogne one hour
      after sunset on the day named, trusting, no doubt, in his usual marvellous
      good-fortune, his own presence of mind and his great physical and mental
      strength, to escape from the trap into which he was so ready to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      That remained beyond a doubt! Therefore what mattered details?
    </p>
    <p>
      But even at this moment, Chauvelin had already resolved on one great
      thing: namely, that on that eventful day, nothing whatever should be left
      to Chance; he would meet his cunning enemy not only with cunning, but also
      with power, and if the entire force of the republican army then available
      in the north of France had to be requisitioned for the purpose, the
      ramparts of Boulogne would be surrounded and no chance of escape left for
      the daring Scarlet Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wave of meditation, however, was here abruptly stemmed by Blakeney's
      pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud! Monsieur Chauvelin,” he said, “I fear me your luck has deserted you.
      Chance, as you see, has turned to me once more.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then it is for you, Sir Percy,” rejoined the Frenchman, “to name the
      conditions under which we are to fight.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! that is so, is it not, Monsieur?” quoth Sir Percy lightly. “By my
      faith! I'll not plague you with formalities.... We'll fight with our coats
      on if it be cold, in our shirtsleeves if it be sultry.... I'll not demand
      either green socks or scarlet ornaments. I'll even try and be serious for
      the space of two minutes, sir, and confine my whole attention—the
      product of my infinitesimal brain—to thinking out some pleasant
      detail for this duel, which might be acceptable to you. Thus, sir, the
      thought of weapons springs to my mind.... Swords you said, I think. Sir! I
      will e'en restrict my choice of conditions to that of the actual weapons
      with which we are to fight.... Ffoulkes, I pray you,” he added, turning to
      his friend, “the pair of swords which lie across the top of my desk at
      this moment....
    </p>
    <p>
      “We'll not ask a menial to fetch them, eh, Monsieur?” he continued gaily,
      as Sir Andrew Ffoulkes at a sign from him had quickly left the room. “What
      need to bruit our pleasant quarrel abroad? You will like the weapons, sir,
      and you shall have your own choice from the pair.... You are a fine
      fencer, I feel sure... and you shall decide if a scratch or two or a more
      serious wound shall be sufficient to avenge Mademoiselle Candeille's
      wounded vanity.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he prattled so gaily on, there was dead silence among all those
      present. The Prince had his shrewd eyes steadily fixed upon him, obviously
      wondering what this seemingly irresponsible adventurer held at the back of
      his mind. There is no doubt that everyone felt oppressed, and that a
      strange murmur of anticipatory excitement went round the little room,
      when, a few seconds later, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes returned, with two sheathed
      swords in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blakeney took them from his friend and placed them on the little table in
      front of ex-Ambassador Chauvelin. The spectators strained their necks to
      look at the two weapons. They were exactly similar one to the other: both
      encased in plain black leather sheaths, with steel ferrules polished to
      shine like silver; the handles too were of plain steel, with just the grip
      fashioned in a twisted basket pattern of the same highly-tempered metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What think you of these weapons, Monsieur?” asked Blakeney, who was
      carelessly leaning against the back of a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin took up one of the two swords and slowly drew it from out its
      scabbard, carefully examining the brilliant, narrow steel blade as he did
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A little old-fashioned in style and make, Sir Percy,” he said, closely
      imitating his opponent's easy demeanour, “a trifle heavier, perhaps, than
      we in France have been accustomed to lately, but, nevertheless, a
      beautifully tempered piece of steel.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Of a truth there's not much the matter with the tempering, Monsieur,”
       quoth Blakeney, “the blades were fashioned at Toledo just two hundred
      years ago.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! here I see an inscription,” said Chauvelin, holding the sword close
      to his eyes, the better to see the minute letters engraved in the steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The name of the original owner. I myself bought them—when I
      travelled in Italy—from one of his descendants.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Lorenzo Giovanni Cenci,” said Chauvelin, spelling the Italian names quite
      slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The greatest blackguard that ever trod this earth. You, no doubt,
      Monsieur, know his history better than we do. Rapine, theft, murder,
      nothing came amiss to Signor Lorenzo... neither the deadly drug in the cup
      nor the poisoned dagger.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken lightly, carelessly, with that same tone of easy banter
      which he had not forsaken throughout the evening, and the same drawly
      manner which was habitual to him. But at these last words of his,
      Chauvelin gave a visible start, and then abruptly replaced the sword—which
      he had been examining—upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw a quick, suspicious glance at Blakeney, who, leaning back against
      the chair and one knee resting on the cushioned seat, was idly toying with
      the other blade, the exact pair to the one which the ex-ambassador had so
      suddenly put down.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, Monsieur,” quoth Sir Percy after a slight pause, and meeting with a
      swift glance of lazy irony his opponent's fixed gaze. “Are you satisfied
      with the weapons? Which of the two shall be yours, and which mine?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Of a truth, Sir Percy...” murmured Chauvelin, still hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Monsieur,” interrupted Blakeney with pleasant bonhomie, “I know what
      you would say... of a truth, there is no choice between this pair of
      perfect twins: one is as exquisite as the other.... And yet you must take
      one and I the other... this or that, whichever you prefer.... You shall
      take it home with you to-night and practise thrusting at a haystack or at
      a bobbin, as you please... The sword is yours to command until you have
      used it against my unworthy person... yours until you bring it out four
      days hence—on the southern ramparts of Boulogne, when the cathedral
      bells chime the evening Angelus; then you shall cross it against its
      faithless twin.... There, Monsieur—they are of equal length... of
      equal strength and temper... a perfect pair... Yet I pray you choose.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up both the swords in his hands and carefully balancing them by
      the extreme tip of their steel-bound scabbards, he held them out towards
      the Frenchman. Chauvelin's eyes were fixed upon him, and he from his
      towering height was looking down at the little sable-clad figure before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Terrorist seemed uncertain what to do. Though he was one of those men
      whom by the force of their intellect, the strength of their enthusiasm,
      the power of their cruelty, had built a new anarchical France, had
      overturned a throne and murdered a king, yet now, face to face with this
      affected fop, this lazy and debonnair adventurer, he hesitated—trying
      in vain to read what was going on behind that low, smooth forehead or
      within the depth of those lazy, blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have given several years of his life at this moment for one short
      glimpse into the innermost brain cells of this daring mind, to see the man
      start, quiver but for the fraction of a second, betray himself by a tremor
      of the eyelid. What counterplan was lurking in Percy Blakeney's head, as
      he offered to his opponent the two swords which had once belonged to
      Lorenzo Cenci?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did any thought of foul play, of dark and deadly poisonings linger in the
      fastidious mind of this accomplished gentleman?
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely not!
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin tried to chide himself for such fears. It seemed madness even to
      think of Italian poisons, of the Cencis or the Borgias in the midst of
      this brilliantly lighted English drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But because he was above all a diplomatist, a fencer with words and with
      looks, the envoy of France determined to know, to probe and to read. He
      forced himself once more to careless laughter and nonchalance of manner
      and schooled his lips to smile up with gentle irony at the good-humoured
      face of his arch-enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped one of the swords with his long pointed finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this the one you choose, sir?” asked Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! which do you advise, Sir Percy,” replied Chauvelin lightly. “Which
      of those two blades think you is most like to hold after two hundred years
      the poison of the Cenci?”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Blakeney neither started nor winced. He broke into a laugh, his own
      usual pleasant laugh, half shy and somewhat inane, then said in tones of
      lively astonishment:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Zounds! sir, but you are full of surprises.... Faith! I never would have
      thought of that....Marvellous, I call it... demmed marvellous.... What say
      you, gentlemen?... Your Royal Highness, what think you?... Is not my
      engaging friend here of a most original turn of mind.... Will you have
      this sword or that, Monsieur?... Nay, I must insist—else we shall
      weary our friends if we hesitate too long.... This one then, sir, since
      you have chosen it,” he continued, as Chauvelin finally took one of the
      swords in his hand. “And now for a bowl of punch.... Nay, Monsieur, 'twas
      demmed smart what you said just now... I must insist on your joining us in
      a bowl.... Such wit as yours, Monsieur, must need whetting at times. ... I
      pray you repeat that same sally again...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then finally turning to the Prince and to his friends, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And after that bowl, gentlemen, shall we rejoin the ladies?”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XIII: Reflections
    </h2>
    <p>
      It seemed indeed as if the incident were finally closed, the chief actors
      in the drama having deliberately vacated the centre of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little crowd which had stood in a compact mass round the table, began
      to break up into sundry small groups: laughter and desultory talk, checked
      for a moment by that oppressive sense of unknown danger, which had weighed
      on the spirits of those present, once more became general. Blakeney's
      light-heartedness had put everyone into good-humour; since he evidently
      did not look upon the challenge as a matter of serious moment, why then,
      no one else had any cause for anxiety, and the younger men were right glad
      to join in that bowl of punch which their genial host had offered with so
      merry a grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lacqueys appeared, throwing open the doors. From a distance the sound of
      dance music once more broke upon the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few of the men only remained silent, deliberately holding aloof from the
      renewed mirthfulness. Foremost amongst these was His Royal Highness, who
      was looking distinctly troubled, and who had taken Sir Percy by the arm,
      and was talking to him with obvious earnestness. Lord Anthony Dewhurst and
      Lord Hastings were holding converse in a secluded corner of the room,
      whilst Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, as being the host's most intimate friend, felt
      it incumbent on him to say a few words to ex-Ambassador Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was desirous of effecting a retreat. Blakeney's invitation to
      join in the friendly bowl of punch could not be taken seriously, and the
      Terrorist wanted to be alone, in order to think out the events of the past
      hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lacquey waited on him, took the momentous sword from his hand, found his
      hat and cloak and called his coach for him: Chauvelin having taken formal
      leave of his host and acquaintances, quickly worked his way to the
      staircase and hall, through the less frequented apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sincerely wished to avoid meeting Lady Blakeney face to face. Not that
      the slightest twinge of remorse disturbed his mind, but he feared some
      impulsive action on her part, which indirectly might interfere with his
      future plans. Fortunately no one took much heed of the darkly-clad,
      insignificant little figure that glided so swiftly by, obviously
      determined to escape attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall he found Demoiselle Candeille waiting for him. She, too, had
      evidently been desirous of leaving Blakeney Manor as soon as possible. He
      saw her to her chaise; then escorted her as far as her lodgings, which
      were close by: there were still one or two things which he wished to
      discuss with her, one or two final instructions which he desired to give.
    </p>
    <p>
      One the whole, he was satisfied with his evening's work: the young actress
      had well supported him, and had played her part so far with marvellous
      sang-froid and skill. Sir Percy, whether willingly or blindly, had seemed
      only too ready to walk into the trap which was being set for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact alone disturbed Chauvelin not a little, and as half an hour or
      so later, having taken final leave of his ally, he sat alone in the coach,
      which was conveying him back to town, the sword of Lorenzo Cenci close to
      his hand, he pondered very seriously over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the adventurous Scarlet Pimpernel should have guessed all along, that
      sooner or later the French Revolutionary Government—whom he had
      defrauded of some of its most important victims,—would desire to be
      even with him, and to bring him to the scaffold, was not to be wondered
      at. But that he should be so blind as to imagine that Chauvelin's
      challenge was anything else but a lure to induce him to go to France,
      could not possibly be supposed. So bold an adventurer, so keen an
      intriguer was sure to have scented the trap immediately, and if he
      appeared ready to fall into it, it was because there had already sprung up
      in his resourceful mind some bold coup or subtle counterplan, with which
      he hoped to gratify his own passionate love of sport, whilst once more
      bringing his enemies to discomfiture and humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly Sir Percy Blakeney, as an accomplished gentleman of the
      period, could not very well under the circumstances which had been so
      carefully stage-managed and arranged by Chauvelin, refuse the latter's
      challenge to fight him on the other side of the Channel. Any hesitation on
      the part of the leader of that daring Scarlet Pimpernel League would have
      covered him with a faint suspicion of pusillanimity, and a subtle breath
      of ridicule, and in a moment the prestige of the unknown and elusive hero
      would have vanished forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But apart from the necessity of the fight, Blakeney seemed to enter into
      the spirit of the plot directed against his own life, with such
      light-hearted merriment, such zest and joy, that Chauvelin could not help
      but be convinced that the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel at Boulogne or
      elsewhere would not prove quite so easy a matter as he had at first
      anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night he wrote a long and circumstantial letter to his
      colleague, Citizen Robespierre, shifting thereby, as it were, some of the
      responsibility of coming events from his own shoulders on to the executive
      of the Committee of Public Safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre,” he wrote, “and to the members
      of the Revolutionary Government who have entrusted me with the delicate
      mission, that four days from this date at one hour after sunset, the man
      who goes by the mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel, will be on the
      ramparts of Boulogne on the south side of the town. I have done what has
      been asked of me. On that day and at that hour, I shall have brought the
      enemy of the Revolution, the intriguer against the policy of the republic,
      within the power of the government which he has flouted and outraged. Now
      look to it, citizens all, that the fruits of my diplomacy and of my skill
      be not lost to France again. The man will be there at my bidding, 'tis for
      you to see that he does not escape this time.”
     </p>
    <p>
      This letter he sent by special courier which the National Convention had
      placed at his disposal in case of emergency. Having sealed it and
      entrusted it to the man, Chauvelin felt at peace with the world and with
      himself. Although he was not so sure of success as he would have wished,
      he yet could not see <i>how</i> failure could possibly come about: and the
      only regret which he felt to-night, when he finally in the early dawn
      sought a few hours' troubled rest, was that that momentous fourth day was
      still so very far distant.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XIV: The Ruling Passion
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile silence had fallen over the beautiful old manorial house.
      One by one the guests had departed, leaving that peaceful sense of
      complete calm and isolation which follows the noisy chatter of any great
      throng bent chiefly on enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening had been universally acknowledged to have been brilliantly
      successful. True, the much talked of French artiste had not sung the
      promised ditties, but in the midst of the whirl and excitement of dances,
      of the inspiring tunes of the string band, the elaborate supper and
      recherche wines, no one had paid much heed to this change in the programme
      of entertainments.
    </p>
    <p>
      And everyone had agreed that never had Lady Blakeney looked more radiantly
      beautiful than on this night. She seemed absolutely indefatigable; a
      perfect hostess, full of charming little attentions towards every one,
      although more than ordinarily absorbed by her duties towards her many
      royal guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic incidents which had taken place in the small boudoir had not
      been much bruited abroad. It was always considered bad form in those
      courtly days to discuss men's quarrels before ladies, and in this
      instance, those who were present when it all occurred instinctively felt
      that their discretion would be appreciated in high circles, and held their
      tongues accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the brilliant evening was brought to a happy conclusion without a
      single cloud to mar the enjoyment of the guests. Marguerite performed a
      veritable miracle of fortitude, forcing her very smiles to seem natural
      and gay, chatting pleasantly, even wittily, upon every known fashionable
      topic of the day, laughing merrily the while her poor, aching heart was
      filled with unspeakable misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when everybody had gone, when the last of her guests had bobbed
      before her the prescribed curtsey, to which she had invariably responded
      with the same air of easy self-possession, now at last she felt free to
      give rein to her thoughts, to indulge in the luxury of looking her own
      anxiety straight in the face and to let the tension of her nerves relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Andrew Ffoulkes had been the last to leave and Percy had strolled out
      with him as far as the garden gate, for Lady Ffoulkes had left in her
      chaise some time ago, and Sir Andrew meant to walk to his home, not many
      yards distant from Blakeney Manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself Marguerite felt her heartstrings tighten as she
      thought of this young couple so lately wedded. People smiled a little when
      Sir Andrew Ffoulkes' name was mentioned, some called him effeminate,
      others uxorious, his fond attachment for his pretty little wife was
      thought to pass the bounds of decorum. There was no doubt that since his
      marriage the young man had greatly changed. His love of sport and
      adventure seemed to have died out completely, yielding evidently to the
      great, more overpowering love, that for his young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suzanne was nervous for her husband's safety. She had sufficient influence
      over him to keep him at home, when other members of the brave little
      League of The Scarlet Pimpernel followed their leader with mad zest, on
      some bold adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite too at first had smiled in kindly derision when Suzanne
      Ffoulkes, her large eyes filled with tears, had used her wiles to keep Sir
      Andrew tied to her own dainty apronstrings. But somehow, lately, with that
      gentle contempt which she felt for the weaker man, there had mingled a
      half-acknowledged sense of envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different 'twixt her and her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy loved her truly and with a depth of passion proportionate to his own
      curious dual personality: it were sacrilege, almost, to doubt the
      intensity of his love. But nevertheless she had at all times a feeling as
      if he were holding himself and his emotions in check, as if his love, as
      if she, Marguerite, his wife, were but secondary matters in his life; as
      if her anxieties, her sorrow when he left her, her fears for his safety
      were but small episodes in the great book of life which he had planned out
      and conceived for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she would hate herself for such thoughts: they seemed like doubts of
      him. Did any man ever love a woman, she asked herself, as Percy loved her?
      He was difficult to understand, and perhaps—oh! that was an awful
      “perhaps”—perhaps there lurked somewhere in his mind a slight
      mistrust of her. She had betrayed him once! unwittingly 'tis true! did he
      fear she might do so again?
    </p>
    <p>
      And to-night after her guests had gone she threw open the great windows
      that gave on the beautiful terrace, with its marble steps leading down to
      the cool river beyond. Everything now seemed so peaceful and still; the
      scent of the heliotrope made the midnight air swoon with its intoxicating
      fragrance: the rhythmic murmur of the waters came gently echoing from
      below, and from far away there came the melancholy cry of a night-bird on
      the prowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      That cry made Marguerite shudder: her thoughts flew back to the episodes
      of this night and to Chauvelin, the dark bird of prey with his mysterious
      death-dealing plans, his subtle intrigues which all tended towards the
      destruction of one man: his enemy, the husband whom Marguerite loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! how she hated these wild adventures which took Percy away from her
      side. Is not a woman who loves—be it husband or child—the most
      truly selfish, the most cruelly callous creature in the world, there,
      where the safety and the well-being of the loved one is in direct conflict
      with the safety and well-being of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would right gladly have closed her eyes to every horror perpetrated in
      France, she would not have known what went on in Paris, she wanted her
      husband! And yet month after month, with but short intervals, she saw him
      risk that precious life of his, which was the very essence of her own
      soul, for others! for others! always for others!
    </p>
    <p>
      And she! she! Marguerite, his wife, was powerless to hold him back!
      powerless to keep him beside her, when that mad fit of passion seized him
      to go on one of those wild quests, wherefrom she always feared he could
      not return alive: and this, although she might use every noble artifice,
      every tender wile of which a loving and beautiful wife is capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times like those her own proud heart was filled with hatred and with
      envy towards everything that took him away from her: and to-night all
      these passionate feelings which she felt were quite unworthy of her and of
      him seemed to surge within her soul more tumultuously than ever. She was
      longing to throw herself in his arms, to pour out into his loving ear all
      that she suffered, in fear and anxiety, and to make one more appeal to his
      tenderness and to that passion which had so often made him forget the
      world at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so instinctively she walked along the terrace towards that more
      secluded part of the garden just above the river bank, where she had so
      oft wandered hand in hand with him, in the honeymoon of their love. There
      great clumps of old-fashioned cabbage roses grew in untidy splendour, and
      belated lilies sent intoxicating odours into the air, whilst the heavy
      masses of Egyptian and Michaelmas daisies looked like ghostly
      constellations in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought Percy must soon be coming this way. Though it was so late, she
      knew that he would not go to bed. After the events of the night, his
      ruling passion, strong in death, would be holding him in its thrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She too felt wide awake and unconscious of fatigue; when she reached the
      secluded path beside the river, she peered eagerly up and down, and
      listened for a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently it seemed to her that above the gentle clapper of the waters she
      could hear a rustle and the scrunching of the fine gravel under carefully
      measured footsteps. She waited a while. The footsteps seemed to draw
      nearer, and soon, although the starlit night was very dark, she perceived
      a cloaked and hooded figure approaching cautiously toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who goes there?” she called suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure paused: then came rapidly forward, and a voice said timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! Lady Blakeney!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” asked Marguerite peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is I... Desiree Candeille,” replied the midnight prowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Demoiselle Candeille!” ejaculated Marguerite, wholly taken by surprise.
      “What are you doing here? alone? and at this hour?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sh-sh-sh...” whispered Candeille eagerly, as she approached quite close
      to Marguerite and drew her hood still lower over her eyes. “I am all alone
      ... I wanted to see someone—you if possible, Lady Blakeney... for I
      could not rest... I wanted to know what had happened.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What had happened? When? I don't understand.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What happened between Citizen Chauvelin and your husband?” asked
      Candeille.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What is that to you?” replied Marguerite haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I pray you do not misunderstand me...” pleaded Candeille eagerly. “I know
      my presence in your house... the quarrel which I provoked must have filled
      your heart with hatred and suspicion towards me... but oh! how can I
      persuade you?... I acted unwillingly... will you not believe me?... I was
      that man's tool... and... Oh God!” she added with sudden, wild vehemence,
      “if only you could know what tyranny that accursed government of France
      exercises over poor helpless women or men who happen to have fallen within
      reach of its relentless clutches...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice broke down in a sob. Marguerite hardly knew what to say or
      think. She had always mistrusted this woman with her theatrical ways and
      stagy airs, from the very first moment she saw her in the tent on the
      green: and she did not wish to run counter against her instinct, in
      anything pertaining to the present crisis. And yet in spite of her
      mistrust the actress' vehement words found an echo in the depths of her
      own heart. How well she knew that tyranny of which Candeille spoke with
      such bitterness! Had she not suffered from it, endured terrible sorrow and
      humiliation, when under the ban of that same appalling tyranny she had
      betrayed the identity—then unknown to her—of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel?
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore when Candeille paused after those last excited words, she said
      with more gentleness than she had shown hitherto, though still quite
      coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you have not yet told me why you came back here to-night? If Citizen
      Chauvelin was your taskmaster, then you must know all that has occurred.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I had a vague hope that I might see you.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “For what purpose?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “To warn you if I could.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I need no warning.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Or are too proud to take one.... Do you know, Lady Blakeney, that Citizen
      Chauvelin has a personal hatred against your husband?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “How do you know that?” asked Marguerite, with her suspicions once more on
      the qui-vive. She could not understand Candeille's attitude. This midnight
      visit, the vehemence of her language, the strange mixture of knowledge and
      ignorance which she displayed. What did this woman know of Chauvelin's
      secret plans? Was she his open ally, or his helpless tool? And was she
      even now playing a part taught her or commanded her by that prince of
      intriguers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Candeille, however, seemed quite unaware of the spirit of antagonism and
      mistrust which Marguerite took but little pains now to disguise. She
      clasped her hands together, and her voice shook with the earnestness of
      her entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” she said eagerly, “have I not seen that look of hatred in
      Chauvelin's cruel eyes?... He hates your husband, I tell you.... Why I
      know not... but he hates him.. and means that great harm shall come to Sir
      Percy through this absurd duel.... Oh! Lady Blakeney, do not let him go...
      I entreat you, do not let him go!”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Marguerite proudly drew back a step or two, away from the reach of
      those hands, stretched out towards her in such vehement appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are overwrought, Mademoiselle,” she said coldly. “Believe me, I have
      no need either of your entreaties or of your warning.... I should like you
      to think that I have no wish to be ungrateful... that I appreciate any
      kind thought you may have harboured for me in your mind.... But beyond
      that... please forgive me if I say it somewhat crudely—I do not feel
      that the matter concerns you in the least.... The hour is late,” she added
      more gently, as if desiring to attenuate the harshness of her last words.
      “Shall I send my maid to escort you home? She is devoted and discreet...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay!” retorted the other in tones of quiet sadness, “there is no need of
      discretion... I am not ashamed of my visit to you to-night.... You are
      very proud, and for your sake I will pray to God that sorrow and
      humiliation may not come to you, as I feared.... We are never likely to
      meet again, Lady Blakeney... you will not wish it, and I shall have passed
      out of your life as swiftly as I had entered into it.... But there was
      another thought lurking in my mind when I came to-night.... In case Sir
      Percy goes to France... the duel is to take place in or near Boulogne...
      this much I do know... would you not wish to go with him?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Truly, Mademoiselle, I must repeat to you...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “That 'tis no concern of mine... I know... I own that.... But, you see
      when I came back here to-night in the silence and the darkness—I had
      not guessed that you would be so proud... I thought that I, a woman, would
      know how to touch your womanly heart.... I was clumsy, I suppose.... I
      made so sure that you would wish to go with your husband, in case... in
      case he insisted on running his head into the noose, which I feel sure
      Chauvelin has prepared for him.... I myself start for France shortly.
      Citizen Chauvelin has provided me with the necessary passport for myself
      and my maid, who was to have accompanied me.... Then, just now, when I was
      all alone... and thought over all the mischief which that fiend had forced
      me to do for him, it seemed to me that perhaps...”
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke off abruptly, and tried to read the other woman's face in the
      gloom. But Marguerite, who was taller than the Frenchwoman, was standing,
      very stiff and erect, giving the young actress neither discouragement nor
      confidence. She did not interrupt Candeille's long and voluble
      explanation: vaguely she wondered what it was all about, and even now when
      the Frenchwoman paused, Marguerite said nothing, but watched her quietly
      as she took a folded paper from the capacious pocket of her cloak and then
      held it out with a look of timidity towards Lady Blakeney.

    <p>
      “My maid need not come with me,” said Desiree Candeille humbly. “I would
      far rather travel alone... this is her passport and... Oh! you need not
      take it out of my hand,” she added in tones of bitter self-deprecation, as
      Marguerite made no sign of taking the paper from her. “See! I will leave
      it here among the roses!... You mistrust me now... it is only natural...
      presently, perhaps, calmer reflection will come... you will see that my
      purpose now is selfless... that I only wish to serve you and him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She stooped and placed the folded paper in the midst of a great clump of
      centifolium roses, and then without another word she turned and went her
      way. For a few moments, whilst Marguerite still stood there, puzzled and
      vaguely moved, she could hear the gentle frou-frou of the other woman's
      skirts against the soft sand of the path, and then a long-drawn sigh that
      sounded like a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all was still again. The gentle midnight breeze caressed the tops of
      the ancient oaks and elms behind her, drawing murmurs from their dying
      leaves like unto the whisperings of ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite shuddered with a slight sense of cold. Before her, amongst the
      dark clump of leaves and the roses, invisible in the gloom, there
      fluttered with a curious, melancholy flapping, the folded paper placed
      there by Candeille. She watched it for awhile, as, disturbed by the wind,
      it seemed ready to take its flight towards the river. Anon it fell to the
      ground, and Marguerite with sudden overpowering impulse, stooped and
      picked it up. Then clutching it nervously in her hand, she walked rapidly
      back towards the house.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XV: Farewell
    </h2>
    <p>
      As she neared the terrace, she became conscious of several forms moving
      about at the foot of the steps, some few feet below where she was
      standing. Soon she saw the glimmer of lanthorns, heard whispering voices,
      and the lapping of the water against the side of a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon a figure, laden with cloaks and sundry packages, passed down the
      steps close beside her. Even in the darkness Marguerite recognized Benyon,
      her husband's confidential valet. Without a moment's hesitation, she flew
      along the terrace towards the wing of the house occupied by Sir Percy. She
      had not gone far before she discerned his tall figure walking leisurely
      along the path which here skirted part of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had on his large caped coat, which was thrown open in front, displaying
      a grey travelling suit of fine cloth; his hands were as usual buried in
      the pockets of his breeches, and on his head he wore the folding
      chapeau-bras which he habitually affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had time to think, or to realize that he was going, before she
      could utter one single word, she was in his arms, clinging to him with
      passionate intensity, trying in the gloom to catch every expression of his
      eyes, every quiver of the face now bent down so close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy, you cannot go... you cannot go!...” she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had felt his strong arms closing round her, his lips seeking hers, her
      eyes, her hair, her clinging hands, which dragged at his shoulders in a
      wild agony of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you really loved me, Percy,” she murmured, “you would not go, you
      would not go...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He would not trust himself to speak; it well-nigh seemed as if his sinews
      cracked with the violent effort at self-control. Oh! how she loved him,
      when she felt in him the passionate lover, the wild, untamed creature that
      he was at heart, on whom the frigid courtliness of manner sat but as a
      thin veneer. This was his own real personality, and there was little now
      of the elegant and accomplished gentleman of fashion, schooled to hold
      every emotion in check, to hide every thought, every desire save that for
      amusement or for display.
    </p>
    <p>
      She—feeling her power and his weakness now—gave herself wholly
      to his embrace, not grudging one single, passionate caress, yielding her
      lips to him, the while she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You cannot go... you cannot... why should you go?... It is madness to
      leave me... I cannot let you go...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Her arms clung tenderly round him, her voice was warm and faintly shaken
      with suppressed tears, and as he wildly murmured: “Don't! for pity's
      sake!” she almost felt that her love would be triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For pity's sake, I'll go on pleading, Percy!” she whispered. “Oh! my
      love, my dear! do not leave me!... we have scarce had time to savour our
      happiness.. we have such arrears of joy to make up.... Do not go, Percy...
      there's so much I want to say to you.... Nay! you shall not! you shall
      not!” she added with sudden vehemence. “Look me straight in the eyes, my
      dear, and tell me if you can leave now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, but, almost roughly, he placed his hand over her
      tear-dimmed eyes, which were turned up to his, in an agony of tender
      appeal. Thus he blindfolded her with that wild caress. She should not see—no,
      not even she!—that for the space of a few seconds stern manhood was
      well-nigh vanquished by the magic of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that was most human in him, all that was weak in this strong and
      untamed nature, cried aloud for peace and luxury and idleness: for long
      summer afternoons spent in lazy content, for the companionship of horses
      and dogs and of flowers, with no thought or cares save those for the next
      evening's gavotte, no graver occupation save that of sitting at HER feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during these few seconds, whilst his hand lay across her eyes, the
      lazy, idle fop of fashionable London was fighting a hand-to-hand fight
      with the bold leader of a band of adventurers: and his own passionate love
      for his wife ranged itself with fervent intensity on the side of his
      weaker self. Forgotten were the horrors of the guillotine, the calls of
      the innocent, the appeal of the helpless; forgotten the daring adventures,
      the excitements, the hair's-breadth escapes; for those few seconds,
      heavenly in themselves, he only remembered her—his wife—her
      beauty and her tender appeal to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have pleaded again, for she felt that she was winning in this
      fight: her instinct—that unerring instinct of the woman who loves
      and feels herself beloved—told her that for the space of an
      infinitesimal fraction of time, his iron will was inclined to bend; but he
      checked her pleading with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there came a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a gigantic wave carried inwards by the tide, his turbulent emotion
      seemed suddenly to shatter itself against a rock of self-control. Was it a
      call from the boatmen below? a distant scrunching of feet upon the gravel?—who
      knows, perhaps only a sigh in the midnight air, a ghostly summons from the
      land of dreams that recalled him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as Marguerite was still clinging to him, with the ardent fervour of
      her own passion, she felt the rigid tension of his arms relax, the power
      of his embrace weaken, the wild love-light become dim in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her fondly, tenderly, and with infinite gentleness smoothed away
      the little damp curls from her brow. There was a wistfulness now in his
      caress, and in his kiss there was the finality of a long farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      “'Tis time I went,” he said, “or we shall miss the tide.”
     </p>
    <p>
      These were the first coherent words he had spoken since first she had met
      him here in this lonely part of the garden, and his voice was perfectly
      steady, conventional and cold. An icy pang shot through Marguerite's
      heart. It was as if she had been abruptly wakened from a beautiful dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are not going, Percy!” she murmured, and her own voice now sounded
      hollow and forced. “Oh! if you loved me you would not go!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “If I love you!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Nay! in this at least there was no dream! no coldness in his voice when he
      repeated those words with such a sigh of tenderness, such a world of
      longing, that the bitterness of her great pain vanished, giving place to
      tears. He took her hand in his. The passion was momentarily conquered,
      forced within his innermost soul, by his own alter ego, that second
      personality in him, the cold-blooded and coolly-calculating adventurer who
      juggled with his life and tossed it recklessly upon the sea of chance
      'twixt a doggerel and a smile. But the tender love lingered on, fighting
      the enemy a while longer, the wistful desire was there for her kiss, the
      tired longing for the exquisite repose of her embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with the warmth of
      his kiss upon it, she felt a moisture like a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must go, dear,” he said, after a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why? Why?” she repeated obstinately. “Am I nothing then? Is my life of no
      account? My sorrows? My fears? My misery? Oh!” she added with vehement
      bitterness, “why should it always be others? What are others to you and to
      me, Percy?... Are we not happy here?... Have you not fulfilled to its
      uttermost that self-imposed duty to people who can be nothing to us?... Is
      not your life ten thousand times more precious to me than the lives of ten
      thousand others?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Even through the darkness, and because his face was so close to hers, she
      could see a quaint little smile playing round the corners of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, m'dear,” he said gently, “'tis not ten thousand lives that call to
      me to-day... only one at best.... Don't you hate to think of that poor
      little old cure sitting in the midst of his ruined pride and hopes: the
      jewels so confidently entrusted to his care, stolen from him, he waiting,
      perhaps, in his little presbytery for the day when those brutes will march
      him to prison and to death.... Nay! I think a little sea voyage and
      English country air would suit the Abbe Foucquet, m'dear, and I only mean
      to ask him to cross the Channel with me!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Percy!” she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! I know! I know!” he rejoined with that short deprecatory sigh of his,
      which seemed always to close any discussion between them on that point,
      “you are thinking of that absurd duel...” He laughed lightly,
      good-humouredly, and his eyes gleamed with merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “La, m'dear!” he said gaily, “will you not reflect a moment? Could I
      refuse the challenge before His Royal Highness and the ladies? I couldn't.
      ... Faith! that was it.... Just a case of couldn't.... Fate did it all...
      the quarrel... my interference... the challenge.... HE had planned it all
      of course.... Let us own that he is a brave man, seeing that he and I are
      not even yet, for that beating he gave me on the Calais cliffs.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! he has planned it all,” she retorted vehemently. “The quarrel
      to-night, your journey to France, your meeting with him face to face at a
      given hour and place where he can most readily, most easily close the
      death-trap upon you.”
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he broke into a laugh. A good, hearty laugh, full of the joy of
      living, of the madness and intoxication of a bold adventure, a laugh that
      had not one particle of anxiety or of tremor in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! m'dear!” he said, “but your ladyship is astonishing.... Close a
      death-trap upon your humble servant?... Nay! the governing citizens of
      France will have to be very active and mighty wide-awake ere they succeed
      in stealing a march on me.... Zounds! but we'll give them an exciting
      chase this time.... Nay! little woman, do not fear!” he said with sudden
      infinite gentleness, “those demmed murderers have not got me yet.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh! how often she had fought with him thus: with him, the adventurer, the
      part of his dual nature that was her bitter enemy, and which took him, the
      lover, away from her side. She knew so well the finality of it all, the
      amazing hold which that unconquerable desire for these mad adventures had
      upon him. Impulsive, ardent as she was, Marguerite felt in her very soul
      an overwhelming fury against herself for her own weakness, her own
      powerlessness in the face of that which forever threatened to ruin her
      life and her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! and his also! for he loved her! he loved her! he loved her! the
      thought went on hammering in her mind, for she knew of its great truth! He
      loved her and went away! And she, poor, puny weakling, was unable to hold
      him back; the tendrils which fastened his soul to hers were not so
      tenacious as those which made him cling to suffering humanity, over there
      in France, where men and women were in fear of death and torture, and
      looked upon the elusive and mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel as a heaven-born
      hero sent to save them from their doom. To them at these times his very
      heartstrings seemed to turn with unconquerable force, and when, with all
      the ardour of her own passion, she tried to play upon the cords of his
      love for her, he could not respond, for they—the strangers—had
      the stronger claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet through it all she knew that this love of humanity, this mad
      desire to serve and to help, in no way detracted from his love for her.
      Nay, it intensified it, made it purer and better, adding to the joy of
      perfect intercourse the poetic and subtle fragrance of ever-recurring
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now at last she felt weary of the fight: her heart was aching, bruised
      and sore. An infinite fatigue seemed to weigh like lead upon her very
      soul. This seemed so different to any other parting, that had perforce
      been during the past year. The presence of Chauvelin in her house, the
      obvious planning of this departure for France, had filled her with a
      foreboding, nay, almost a certitude of a gigantic and deadly cataclysm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her senses began to reel; she seemed not to see anything very distinctly:
      even the loved form took on a strange and ghostlike shape. He now looked
      preternaturally tall, and there was a mist between her and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that he spoke to her again, but she was not quite sure, for
      his voice sounded like some weird and mysterious echo. A bosquet of
      climbing heliotrope close by threw a fragrance into the evening air, which
      turned her giddy with its overpowering sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes, for she felt as if she must die, if she held them
      open any longer; and as she closed them it seemed to her as if he folded
      her in one last, long, heavenly embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her graceful figure swaying in his arms like a tall and slender
      lily bending to the wind. He saw that she was but half-conscious, and
      thanked heaven for this kindly solace to his heart-breaking farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sloping, mossy bank close by, there where the marble terrace
      yielded to the encroaching shrubbery: a tangle of pale pink monthly roses
      made a bower overhead. She was just sufficiently conscious to enable him
      to lead her to this soft green couch. There he laid her amongst the roses,
      kissed the dear, tired eyes, her hands, her lips, her tiny feet, and went.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XVI: The Passport
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rhythmic clapper of oars roused Marguerite from this trance-like
      swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she was on her feet, all her fatigue gone, her numbness of
      soul and body vanished as in a flash. She was fully conscious now!
      conscious that he had gone! that according to every probability under
      heaven and every machination concocted in hell, he would never return from
      France alive, and that she had failed to hear the last words which he
      spoke to her, had failed to glean his last look or to savour his final
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the night was starlit and balmy it was singularly dark, and vainly
      did Marguerite strain her eyes to catch sight of that boat which was
      bearing him away so swiftly now: she strained her ears, vaguely hoping to
      catch one last, lingering echo of his voice. But all was silence, save
      that monotonous clapper, which seemed to beat against her heart like a
      rhythmic knell of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hear the oars distinctly: there were six or eight, she thought:
      certainly no fewer. Eight oarsmen probably, which meant the larger boat,
      and undoubtedly the longer journey... not to London only with a view to
      posting to Dover, but to Tilbury Fort, where the “Day Dream” would be in
      readiness to start with a favourable tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought was returning to her, slowly and coherently: the pain of the last
      farewell was still there, bruising her very senses with its dull and heavy
      weight, but it had become numb and dead, leaving her, herself, her heart
      and soul, stunned and apathetic, whilst her brain was gradually resuming
      its activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the more she thought it over, the more certain she grew that her
      husband was going as far as Tilbury by river and would embark on the “Day
      Dream” there. Of course he would go to Boulogne at once. The duel was to
      take place there, Candeille had told her that... adding that she thought
      she, Marguerite, would wish to go with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavens above! was not that the only real, tangible thought in that
      whirling chaos which was raging in her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      To go with him! Surely there must be some means of reaching him yet! Fate,
      Nature, God Himself would never permit so monstrous a thing as this: that
      she should be parted from her husband, now when his life was not only in
      danger, but forfeited already... lost... a precious thing all but gone
      from this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy was going to Boulogne... she must go too. By posting at once to
      Dover, she could get the tidal boat on the morrow and reach the French
      coast quite as soon as the “Day Dream.” Once at Boulogne, she would have
      no difficulty in finding her husband, of that she felt sure. She would
      have but to dog Chauvelin's footsteps, find out something of his plans, of
      the orders he gave to troops or to spies,—oh! she would find him! of
      that she was never for a moment in doubt!
    </p>
    <p>
      How well she remembered her journey to Calais just a year ago, in company
      with Sir Andrew Ffoulkes! Chance had favoured her then, had enabled her to
      be of service to her husband if only by distracting Chauvelin's attention
      for awhile to herself. Heaven knows! she had but little hope of being of
      use to him now: an aching sense was in her that fate had at last been too
      strong! that the daring adventurer had staked once too often, had cast the
      die and had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bosom of her dress she felt the sharp edge of the paper left for
      her by Desiree Candeille among the roses in the park. She had picked it up
      almost mechanically then, and tucked it away, hardly heeding what she was
      doing. Whatever the motive of the French actress had been in placing the
      passport at her disposal, Marguerite blessed her in her heart for it. To
      the woman she had mistrusted, she would owe the last supreme happiness of
      her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her resolution never once wavered. Percy would not take her with him: that
      was understandable. She could neither expect it nor think it. But she, on
      the other hand, could not stay in England, at Blakeney Manor, whilst any
      day, any hour, the death-trap set by Chauvelin for the Scarlet Pimpernel
      might be closing upon the man whom she worshipped. She would go mad if she
      stayed. As there could be no chance of escape for Percy now, as he had
      agreed to meet his deadly enemy face to face at a given place, and a given
      hour, she could not be a hindrance to him: and she knew enough subterfuge,
      enough machinations and disguises by now, to escape Chauvelin's
      observation, unless... unless Percy wanted her, and then she would be
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! she could not be a hindrance. She had a passport in her pocket,
      everything en regle, nobody could harm her, and she could come and go as
      she pleased. There were plenty of swift horses in the stables, plenty of
      devoted servants to do her bidding quickly and discreetly: moreover, at
      moments like these, conventionalities and the possible conjectures and
      surmises of others became of infinitesimally small importance. The
      household of Blakeney Manor were accustomed to the master's sudden
      journeys and absences of several days, presumably on some shooting or
      other sporting expeditions, with no one in attendance on him, save Benyon,
      his favourite valet. These passed without any comments now! Bah! let
      everyone marvel for once at her ladyship's sudden desire to go to Dover,
      and let it all be a nine days' wonder; she certainly did not care.
      Skirting the house, she reached the stables beyond. One or two men were
      astir. To these she gave the necessary orders for her coach and four, then
      she found her way back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking along the corridor, she went past the room occupied by Juliette de
      Marny. For a moment she hesitated, then she turned and knocked at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Juliette was not yet in bed, for she went to the door herself and opened
      it. Obviously she had been quite unable to rest, her hair was falling
      loosely over her shoulders, and there was a look of grave anxiety on her
      young face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Juliette,” said Marguerite in a hurried whisper, the moment she had
      closed the door behind her and she and the young girl were alone, “I am
      going to France to be near my husband. He has gone to meet that fiend in a
      duel which is nothing but a trap, set to capture him, and lead him to his
      death. I want you to be of help to me, here in my house, in my absence.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I would give my life for you, Lady Blakeney,” said Juliette simply, “is
      it not HIS since he saved it?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is only a little presence of mind, a little coolness and patience,
      which I will ask of you, dear,” said Marguerite. “You of course know who
      your rescuer was, therefore you will understand my fears. Until to-night,
      I had vague doubts as to how much Chauvelin really knew, but now these
      doubts have naturally vanished. He and the French Revolutionary Government
      know that the Scarlet Pimpernel and Percy Blakeney are one and the same.
      The whole scene to-night was prearranged: you and I and all the
      spectators, and that woman Candeille—we were all puppets piping to
      that devil's tune. The duel, too, was prearranged!... that woman wearing
      your mother's jewels!... Had you not provoked her, a quarrel between her
      and me, or one of my guests would have been forced somehow... I wanted to
      tell you this, lest you should fret, and think that you were in any way
      responsible for what has happened.... You were not.... He had arranged it
      all.... You were only the tool... just as I was. ... You must understand
      and believe that.... Percy would hate to think that you felt yourself to
      blame... you are not that, in any way.... The challenge was bound to
      come.... Chauvelin had arranged that it should come, and if you had failed
      him as a tool, he soon would have found another! Do you believe that?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I believe that you are an angel of goodness, Lady Blakeney,” replied
      Juliette, struggling with her tears, “and that you are the only woman in
      the world worthy to be his wife.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But,” insisted Marguerite firmly, as the young girl took her cold hand in
      her own, and gently fondling it, covered it with grateful kisses, “but
      if... if anything happens... anon... you will believe firmly that you were
      in no way responsible?... that you were innocent.. and merely a blind
      tool?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “God bless you for that!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You will believe it?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I will.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And now for my request,” rejoined Lady Blakeney in a more quiet, more
      matter-of-fact tone of voice. “You must represent me, here, when I am
      gone: explain as casually and as naturally as you can, that I have gone to
      join my husband on his yacht for a few days. Lucie, my maid, is devoted
      and a tower of secrecy; she will stand between you and the rest of the
      household, in concocting some plausible story. To every friend who calls,
      to anyone of our world whom you may meet, you must tell the same tale, and
      if you note an air of incredulity in anyone, if you hear whispers of there
      being some mystery, well! let the world wag its busy tongue—I care
      less than naught: it will soon tire of me and my doings, and having torn
      my reputation to shreds will quickly leave me in peace. But to Sir Andrew
      Ffoulkes,” she added earnestly, “tell the whole truth from me. He will
      understand and do as he thinks right.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I will do all you ask, Lady Blakeney, and am proud to think that I shall
      be serving you, even in so humble and easy a capacity. When do you start?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “At once. Good-bye, Juliette.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent down to the young girl and kissed her tenderly on the forehead,
      then she glided out of the room as rapidly as she had come. Juliette, of
      course, did not try to detain her, or to force her help of companionship
      on her when obviously she would wish to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite quickly reached her room. Her maid Lucie was already waiting
      for her. Devoted and silent as she was, one glance at her mistress' face
      told her that trouble—grave and imminent—had reached Blakeney
      Manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite, whilst Lucie undressed her, took up the passport and carefully
      perused the personal description of one, Celine Dumont, maid to Citizeness
      Desiree Candeille, which was given therein: tall, blue eyes, light hair,
      age about twenty-five. It all might have been vaguely meant for her. She
      had a dark cloth gown, and long black cloak with hood to come well over
      the head. These she now donned, with some thick shoes, and a dark-coloured
      handkerchief tied over her head under the hood, so as to hide the golden
      glory of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite calm and in no haste. She made Lucie pack a small hand
      valise with some necessaries for the journey, and provided herself
      plentifully with money—French and English notes—which she
      tucked well away inside her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she bade her maid, who was struggling with her tears, a kindly
      farewell, and quickly went down to her coach.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XVII: Boulogne
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the journey Marguerite had not much leisure to think. The
      discomforts and petty miseries incidental on cheap travelling had the very
      welcome effect of making her forget, for the time being, the
      soul-rendering crisis through which she was now passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, of necessity, she had to travel at the cheap rate, among the crowd of
      poorer passengers who were herded aft the packet boat, leaning up against
      one another, sitting on bundles and packages of all kinds; that part of
      the deck, reeking with the smell of tar and sea-water, damp, squally and
      stuffy, was an abomination of hideous discomfort to the dainty, fastidious
      lady of fashion, yet she almost welcomed the intolerable propinquity, the
      cold douches of salt water, which every now and then wetted her through
      and through, for it was the consequent sense of physical wretchedness that
      helped her to forget the intolerable anguish of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And among these poorer travellers she felt secure from observation. No one
      took much notice of her. She looked just like one of the herd, and in the
      huddled-up little figure, in the dark bedraggled clothes, no one would for
      a moment have recognized the dazzling personality of Lady Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing her hood well over her head, she sat in a secluded corner of the
      deck, upon the little black valise which contained the few belongings she
      had brought with her. Her cloak and dress, now mud-stained and dank with
      splashings of salt-water, attracted no one's attention. There was a keen
      northeasterly breeze, cold and penetrating, but favourable to a rapid
      crossing. Marguerite, who had gone through several hours of weary
      travelling by coach, before she had embarked at Dover in the late
      afternoon, was unspeakably tired. She had watched the golden sunset out at
      sea until her eyes were burning with pain, and as the dazzling crimson and
      orange and purple gave place to the soft grey tones of evening, she
      descried the round cupola of the church of Our Lady of Boulogne against
      the dull background of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that her mind became a blank. A sort of torpor fell over her sense:
      she was wakeful and yet half-asleep, unconscious of everything around her,
      seeing nothing but the distant massive towers of old Boulogne churches
      gradually detaching themselves one by one from out the fast gathering
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town seemed like a dream city, a creation of some morbid imagination,
      presented to her mind's eye as the city of sorrow and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boat finally scraped her sides along the rough wooden jetty,
      Marguerite felt as if she were forcibly awakened. She was numb and stiff
      and thought she must have fallen asleep during the last half hour of the
      journey. Everything round her was dark. The sky was overcast, and the
      night seemed unusually sombre. Figures were moving all around her, there
      was noise and confusion of voices, and a general pushing and shouting
      which seemed strangely weird in this gloom. Here among the poorer
      passengers, there had not been thought any necessity for a light, one
      solitary lantern fixed to a mast only enhanced the intense blackness of
      everything around. Now and then a face would come within range of this
      meagre streak of yellow light, looking strangely distorted, with great,
      elongated shadows across the brow and chin, a grotesque, ghostly
      apparition which quickly vanished again, scurrying off like some
      frightened gnome, giving place other forms, other figures all equally
      grotesque and equally weird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite watched them all half stupidly and motionlessly for awhile. She
      did not quite know what she ought to do, and did not like to ask any
      questions: she was dazed and the darkness blinded her. Then gradually
      things began to detach themselves more clearly. On looking straight before
      her, she began to discern the landing place, the little wooden bridge
      across which the passengers walked one by one from the boat onto the
      jetty. The first-class passengers were evidently all alighting now: the
      crowd of which Marguerite formed a unit, had been pushed back in a more
      compact herd, out of the way for the moment, so that their betters might
      get along more comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the landing stage a little booth had been erected, a kind of tent,
      open in front and lighted up within by a couple of lanthorns. Under this
      tent there was a table, behind which sat a man dressed in some sort of
      official looking clothes, and wearing the tricolour scarf across his
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the passengers from the boat had apparently to file past this tent.
      Marguerite could see them now quite distinctly, the profiles of the
      various faces, as they paused for a moment in front of the table, being
      brilliantly illuminated by one of the lanterns. Two sentinels wearing the
      uniform of the National Guard stood each side of the table. The passengers
      one by one took out their passport as they went by, handed it to the man
      in the official dress, who examined it carefully, very lengthily, then
      signed it and returned the paper to its owner: but at times, he appeared
      doubtful, folded the passport and put it down in front of him: the
      passenger would protest; Marguerite could not hear what was said, but she
      could see that some argument was attempted, quickly dismissed by a
      peremptory order from the official. The doubtful passport was obviously
      put on one side for further examination, and the unfortunate owner thereof
      detained, until he or she had been able to give more satisfactory
      references to the representatives of the Committee of Public Safety,
      stationed at Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process of examination necessarily took a long time. Marguerite was
      getting horribly tired, her feet ached and she scarcely could hold herself
      upright: yet she watched all these people mechanically, making absurd
      little guesses in her weary mind as to whose passport would find favour in
      the eyes of the official, and whose would be found suspect and inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suspect! a terrible word these times! since Merlin's terrible law decreed
      now that every man, woman or child, who was suspected by the Republic of
      being a traitor was a traitor in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      How sorry she felt for those whose passports were detained: who tried to
      argue—so needlessly!—and who were finally led off by a
      soldier, who had stepped out from somewhere in the dark, and had to await
      further examination, probably imprisonment and often death.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to herself, she felt quite safe: the passport given to her by
      Chauvelin's own accomplice was sure to be quite en regle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly her heart seemed to give a sudden leap and then to stop in
      its beating for a second or two. In one of the passengers, a man who was
      just passing in front of the tent, she had recognized the form and profile
      of Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no passport to show, but evidently the official knew who he was,
      for he stood up and saluted, and listened deferentially whilst the
      ex-ambassador apparently gave him a few instructions. It seemed to
      Marguerite that these instructions related to two women who were close
      behind Chauvelin at the time, and who presently seemed to file past
      without going through the usual formalities of showing their passports.
      But of this she could not be quite sure. The women were closely hooded and
      veiled and her own attention had been completely absorbed by this sudden
      appearance of her deadly enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what more natural than that Chauvelin should be here now? His object
      accomplished, he had no doubt posted to Dover, just as she had done. There
      was no difficulty in that, and a man of his type and importance would
      always have unlimited means and money at his command to accomplish any
      journey he might desire to undertake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing strange or even unexpected in the man's presence here;
      and yet somehow it had made the whole, awful reality more tangible, more
      wholly unforgettable. Marguerite remembered his abject words to her, when
      first she had seen him at the Richmond fete: he said that he had fallen
      into disgrace, that, having failed in his service to the Republic, he had
      been relegated to a subordinate position, pushed aside with contumely to
      make room for better, abler men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! all that was a lie, of course, a cunning method of gaining access
      into her house; of that she had already been convinced, when Candeille
      provoked the esclandre which led to the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That on French soil he seemed in anything but a subsidiary position, that
      he appeared to rule rather than to obey, could in no way appear to
      Marguerite in the nature of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the actress had been a willing tool in the cunning hands of Chauvelin,
      so were probably all these people around her. Where others cringed in the
      face of officialism, the ex-ambassador had stepped forth as a master: he
      had shown a badge, spoken a word mayhap, and the man in the tent who had
      made other people tremble, stood up deferentially and obeyed all commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very simple and very obvious: but Marguerite's mind had been
      asleep, and it was the sight of the sable-clad little figure which had
      roused it from its happy torpor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment now her brain was active and alert, and presently it seemed to
      her as if another figure—taller than those around—had crossed
      the barrier immediately in the wake of Chauvelin. Then she chided herself
      for her fancies!
    </p>
    <p>
      It could not be her husband. Not yet! He had gone by water, and would
      scarce be in Boulogne before the morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! now at last came the turn of the second-class passengers! There was a
      general bousculade and the human bundle began to move. Marguerite lost
      sight of the tent and its awe-inspiring appurtenances: she was a mere unit
      again in this herd on the move. She too progressed along slowly, one step
      at a time; it was wearisome and she was deadly tired. She was beginning to
      form plans now that she had arrived in France. All along she had made up
      her mind that she would begin by seeking out the Abbe Foucquet, for he
      would prove a link 'twixt her husband and herself. She knew that Percy
      would communicate with the abbe; had he not told her that the rescue of
      the devoted old man from the clutches of the Terrorists would be one of
      the chief objects of his journey? It had never occurred to her what she
      would do if she found the Abbe Foucquet gone from Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He! la mere! your passport!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The rough words roused her from her meditations. She had moved forward,
      quite mechanically, her mind elsewhere, her thoughts not following the aim
      of her feet. Thus she must have crossed the bridge along with some of the
      crowd, must have landed on the jetty, and reached the front of the tent,
      without really knowing what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah yes! her passport! She had quite forgotten that! But she had it by her,
      quite in order, given to her in a fit of tardy remorse by Demoiselle
      Candeille, the intimate friend of one of the most influential members of
      the Revolutionary Government of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the passport from the bosom of her dress and handed it to the man
      in the official dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your name?” he asked peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Celine Dumont,” she replied unhesitatingly, for had she not rehearsed all
      this in her mind dozens of times, until her tongue could rattle off the
      borrowed name as easily as it could her own; “servitor to Citizeness
      Desiree Candeille!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The man who had very carefully been examining the paper the while, placed
      it down on the table deliberately in front of him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Celine Dumont! Eh! la mere! what tricks are you up to now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Tricks? I don't understand!” she said quietly, for she was not afraid.
      The passport was en regle: she knew she had nothing to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! but I think you do!” retorted the official with a sneer, “and 'tis a
      mighty clever one, I'll allow. Celine Dumont, ma foi! Not badly imagined,
      ma petite mere: and all would have passed off splendidly; unfortunately,
      Celine Dumont, servitor to Citizeness Desiree Candeille, passed through
      these barriers along with her mistress not half an hour ago.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And with long, grimy finger he pointed to an entry in the large book which
      lay open before him, and wherein he had apparently been busy making notes
      of the various passengers who had filed past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked up with a triumphant leer at the calm face of Marguerite.
      She still did not feel really frightened, only puzzled and perturbed; but
      all the blood had rushed away from her face, leaving her cheeks ashen
      white, and pressing against her heart, until it almost choked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are making a mistake, Citizen,” she said very quietly. “I am
      Citizeness Candeille's maid. She gave me the passport herself, just before
      I left for England; if you will ask her the question, she will confirm
      what I say, and she assured me that it was quite en regle.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But the man only shrugged his shoulders and laughed derisively. The
      incident evidently amused him, yet he must have seen many of the same
      sort; in the far corner of the tent Marguerite seemed to discern a few
      moving forms, soldiers, she thought, for she caught sight of a glint like
      that of steel. One or two men stood close behind the official at the desk,
      and the sentinels were to the right and left of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an instinctive sense of appeal, Marguerite looked round from one face
      to the other: but each looked absolutely impassive and stolid, quite
      uninterested in this little scene, the exact counterpart of a dozen
      others, enacted on this very spot within the last hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He! la! la! petite mere!” said the official in the same tone of easy
      persiflage which he had adopted all along, “but we do know how to concoct
      a pretty lie, aye! and so circumstantially too! Unfortunately it was
      Citizeness Desiree Candeille herself who happened to be standing just
      where you are at the present moment, along with her maid, Celine Dumont,
      both of whom were specially signed for and recommended as perfectly
      trustworthy, by no less a person than Citoyen Chauvelin of the Committee
      of Public Safety.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But I assure you that there is a mistake,” pleaded Marguerite earnestly,
      “'Tis the other woman who lied, I have my passport and...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A truce on this,” retorted the man peremptorily. “If everything is as you
      say, and if you have nothing to hide, you'll be at liberty to continue
      your journey to-morrow, after you have explained yourself before the
      citizen governor. Next one now, quick!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite tried another protest, just as those others had done, whom she
      had watched so mechanically before. But already she knew that that would
      be useless, for she had felt that a heavy hand was being placed on her
      shoulder, and that she was being roughly led away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash she had understood and seen the whole sequel of the awful trap
      which had all along been destined to engulf her as well as her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a clumsy, blind fool she had been!
    </p>
    <p>
      What a miserable antagonist the subtle schemes of a past master of
      intrigue as was Chauvelin. To have enticed the Scarlet Pimpernel to France
      was a great thing! The challenge was clever, the acceptance of it by the
      bold adventurer a forgone conclusion, but the master stroke of the whole
      plan was done, when she, the wife, was enticed over too with the story of
      Candeille's remorse and the offer of the passport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fool! fool that she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      And how well did Chauvelin know feminine nature! How cleverly he had
      divined her thoughts, her feelings, the impulsive way in which she would
      act; how easily he had guessed that, knowing her husband's danger, she,
      Marguerite, would immediately follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the trap had closed on her—and she saw it all, when it was too
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Percy Blakeney in France! His wife a prisoner! Her freedom and safety in
      exchange for his life!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hopelessness of it all struck her with appalling force, and her senses
      reeled with the awful finality of the disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet instinct in her still struggled for freedom. Ahead of her, and all
      around, beyond the tent and in the far distance there was a provocative
      alluring darkness: if she only could get away, only could reach the
      shelter of that remote and sombre distance, she would hide, and wait, not
      blunder again, oh no! she would be prudent and wary, if only she could get
      away!
    </p>
    <p>
      One woman's struggles, against five men! It was pitiable, sublime,
      absolutely useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in the tent seemed to be watching her with much amusement for a
      moment or two, as her whole graceful body stiffened for that absurd and
      unequal physical contest. He seemed vastly entertained at the sight of
      this good-looking young woman striving to pit her strength against five
      sturdy soldiers of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Allons! that will do now!” he said at last roughly. “We have no time to
      waste! Get the jade away, and let her cool her temper in No. 6, until the
      citizen governor gives further orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take her away!” he shouted more loudly, banging a grimy fist down on the
      table before him, as Marguerite still struggled on with the blind madness
      of despair. “Pardi! can none of you rid us of that turbulent baggage?”
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd behind were pushing forward: the guard within the tent were
      jeering at those who were striving to drag Marguerite away: these latter
      were cursing loudly and volubly, until one of them, tired out, furious and
      brutal, raised his heavy fist and with an obscene oath brought it crashing
      down upon the unfortunate woman's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, though it was the work of a savage and cruel creature, the blow
      proved more merciful than it had been intended: it had caught Marguerite
      full between the eyes; her aching senses, wearied and reeling already,
      gave way beneath this terrible violence; her useless struggles ceased, her
      arms fell inert by her side: and losing consciousness completely, her
      proud, unbendable spirit was spared the humiliating knowledge of her final
      removal by the rough soldiers, and of the complete wreckage of her last,
      lingering hopes.
    </p>

      It was night when last Marguerite had clearly known what was going on
      around her; it was daylight before she realized that she still lived, that
      she still knew and suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head ached intolerably: that was the first conscious sensation which
      came to her; then she vaguely perceived a pale ray of sunshine, very hazy
      and narrow, which came from somewhere in front of her and struck her in
      the face. She kept her eyes tightly shut, for that filmy light caused her
      an increase of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be lying on her back, and her fingers wandering restlessly
      around felt a hard paillasse, beneath their touch, then a rough pillow,
      and her own cloak laid over her: thought had not yet returned, only the
      sensation of great suffering and of infinite fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon she ventured to open her eyes, and gradually one or two objects
      detached themselves from out the haze which still obscured her vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, the narrow aperture—scarcely a window—filled in with
      tiny squares of coarse, unwashed glass, through which the rays of the
      morning sun were making kindly efforts to penetrate, then the cloud of
      dust illumined by those same rays, and made up—so it seemed to the
      poor tired brain that strove to perceive—of myriads of abnormally
      large molecules, over-abundant, and over-active, for they appeared to be
      dancing a kind of wild saraband before Marguerite's aching eyes, advancing
      and retreating, forming themselves into groups and taking on funny shapes
      of weird masques and grotesque faces which grinned at the unconscious
      figure lying helpless on the rough paillasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through and beyond them Marguerite gradually became aware of three walls
      of a narrow room, dank and grey, half covered with whitewash and half with
      greenish mildew! Yes! and there, opposite to her and immediately beneath
      that semblance of a window, was another paillasse, and on it something
      dark, that moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words: “Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite ou la Mort!” stared out at her
      from somewhere beyond those active molecules of dust, but she also saw
      just above the other paillasse the vague outline of a dark crucifix.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a terrible effort to co-ordinate all these things, and to try
      and realize what the room was, and what was the meaning of the paillasse,
      the narrow window and the stained walls, too much altogether for the
      aching head to take in save very slowly, very gradually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite was content to wait and to let memory creep back as reluctantly
      as it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you think, my child, you could drink a little of this now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a gentle, rather tremulous voice which struck upon her ear. She
      opened her eyes, and noticed that the dark something which had previously
      been on the opposite paillasse was no longer there, and that there
      appeared to be a presence close to her only vaguely defined, someone
      kindly and tender who had spoken to her in French, with that soft
      sing-song accent peculiar to the Normandy peasants, and who now seemed to
      be pressing something cool and soothing to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They gave me this for you!” continued the tremulous voice close to her
      ear. “I think it would do you good, if you tried to take it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand and arm was thrust underneath the rough pillow, causing her to
      raise her head a little. A glass was held to her lips and she drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand that held the glass was all wrinkled, brown and dry, and trembled
      slightly, but the arm which supported her head was firm and very kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There! I am sure you feel better now. Close your eyes and try to go to
      sleep.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She did as she was bid, and was ready enough to close her eyes. It seemed
      to her presently as if something had been interposed between her aching
      head and that trying ray of white September sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she slept peacefully for a little while after that, for though her
      head was still very painful, her mouth and throat felt less parched and
      dry. Through this sleep or semblance of sleep, she was conscious of the
      same pleasant voice softly droning Paters and Aves close to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she lay, during the greater part of the day. Not quite fully
      conscious, not quite awake to the awful memories which anon would crowd
      upon her thick and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time the same kind and trembling hands would with gentle
      pressure force a little liquid food through her unwilling lips: some warm
      soup, or anon a glass of milk. Beyond the pain in her head, she was
      conscious of no physical ill; she felt at perfect peace, and an
      extraordinary sense of quiet and repose seemed to pervade this small room,
      with its narrow window through which the rays of the sun came gradually in
      more golden splendour as the day drew towards noon, and then they vanished
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drony voice close beside her acted as a soporific upon her nerves. In
      the afternoon she fell into a real and beneficent sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      But after that, she woke to full consciousness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the horror, the folly of it all!
    </p>
    <p>
      It came back to her with all the inexorable force of an appalling
      certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a prisoner in the hands of those who long ago had sworn to bring
      The Scarlet Pimpernel to death!
    </p>
    <p>
      She! his wife, a hostage in their hands! her freedom and safety offered to
      him as the price of his own! Here there was no question of dreams or of
      nightmares: no illusions as to the ultimate intentions of her husband's
      enemies. It was all a reality, and even now, before she had the strength
      fully to grasp the whole nature of this horrible situation, she knew that
      by her own act of mad and passionate impulse, she had hopelessly
      jeopardized the life of the man she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      For with that sublime confidence in him begotten of her love, she never
      for a moment doubted which of the two alternatives he would choose, when
      once they were placed before him. He would sacrifice himself for her; he
      would prefer to die a thousand deaths so long as they set her free.
    </p>
    <p>
      For herself, her own sufferings, her danger or humiliation she cared
      nothing! Nay! at this very moment she was conscious of a wild passionate
      desire for death.... In this sudden onrush of memory and of thought she
      wished with all her soul and heart and mind to die here suddenly, on this
      hard paillasse, in this lonely and dark prison... so that she should be
      out of the way once and for all... so that she should NOT be the hostage
      to be bartered against his precious life and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would suffer acutely, terribly at her loss, because he loved her above
      everything else on earth, he would suffer in every fibre of his passionate
      and ardent nature, but he would not then have to endure the humiliations,
      the awful alternatives, the galling impotence and miserable death, the
      relentless “either—or” which his enemies were even now preparing for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came a revulsion of feeling. Marguerite's was essentially a
      buoyant and active nature, a keen brain which worked and schemed and
      planned, rather than one ready to accept the inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had these thoughts of despair and of death formulated themselves in
      her mind, than with brilliant swiftness, a new train of ideas began to
      take root.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if matters were not so hopeless after all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Already her mind had flown instinctively to thoughts of escape. Had she
      the right to despair? She, the wife and intimate companion of the man who
      had astonished the world with his daring, his prowess, his amazing good
      luck, she to imagine for a moment that in this all-supreme moment of
      adventurous life the Scarlet Pimpernel would fail!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was not English society peopled with men, women and children whom his
      ingenuity had rescued from plights quite as seemingly hopeless as her own,
      and would not all the resources of that inventive brain be brought to bear
      upon this rescue which touched him nearer and more deeply than any which
      he had attempted hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Marguerite was chiding herself for her doubts and for her fears.
      Already she remembered that amongst the crowd on the landing stage she had
      perceived a figure—unusually tall—following in the wake of
      Chauvelin and his companions. Awakened hope had already assured her that
      she had not been mistaken, that Percy, contrary to her own surmises, had
      reached Boulogne last night: he always acted so differently to what anyone
      might expect, that it was quite possible that he had crossed over in the
      packet-boat after all unbeknown to Marguerite as well as to his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes! the more she thought about it all, the more sure was she that
      Percy was already in Boulogne, and that he knew of her capture and her
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      What right had she to doubt even for a moment that he would know how to
      reach her, how—when the time came—to save himself and her?
    </p>
    <p>
      A warm glow began to fill her veins, she felt excited and alert,
      absolutely unconscious now of pain or fatigue, in this radiant joy of
      reawakened hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised herself slightly, leaning on her elbow: she was still very weak
      and the slight movement had made her giddy, but soon she would be strong
      and well... she must be strong and well and ready to do his bidding when
      the time for escape would have come.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! you are better, my child, I see...” said that quaint, tremulous voice
      again, with its soft sing-song accent, “but you must not be so
      venturesome, you know. The physician said that you had received a cruel
      blow. The brain has been rudely shaken... and you must lie quite still all
      to-day, or your poor little head will begin to ache again.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite turned to look at the speaker, and in spite of her excitement,
      of her sorrow and of her anxieties, she could not help smiling at the
      whimsical little figure which sat opposite to her, on a very rickety
      chair, solemnly striving with slow and measured movement of hand and arm,
      and a large supply of breath, to get up a polish on the worn-out surface
      of an ancient pair of buckled shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure was slender and almost wizened, the thin shoulders round with
      an habitual stoop, the lean shanks were encased in a pair of much-darned,
      coarse black stockings. It was the figure of an old man, with a gentle,
      clear-cut face furrowed by a forest of wrinkles, and surmounted by scanty
      white locks above a smooth forehead which looked yellow and polished like
      an ancient piece of ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had looked across at Marguerite as he spoke, and a pair of innately
      kind and mild blue eyes were fixed with tender reproach upon her.
      Marguerite thought that she had never seen quite so much goodness and
      simple-heartedness portrayed on any face before. It literally beamed out
      of those pale blue eyes, which seemed quite full of unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man wore a tattered garment, a miracle of shining cleanliness,
      which had once been a soutane of smooth black cloth, but was now a mass of
      patches and threadbare at shoulders and knees. He seemed deeply intent in
      the task of polishing his shoes, and having delivered himself of his
      little admonition, he very solemnly and earnestly resumed his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite's first and most natural instinct had, of course, been one of
      dislike and mistrust of anyone who appeared to be in some way on guard
      over her. But when she took in every detail of the quaint figure of the
      old man, his scrupulous tidiness of apparel, the resigned stoop of his
      shoulders, and met in full the gaze of those moist eyes, she felt that the
      whole aspect of the man, as he sat there polishing his shoes, was
      infinitely pathetic and, in its simplicity, commanding of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who are you?” asked Lady Blakeney at last, for the old man after looking
      at her with a kind of appealing wonder, seemed to be waiting for her to
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A priest of the good God, my dear child,” replied the old man with a deep
      sigh and a shake of his scanty locks, “who is not allowed to serve his
      divine Master any longer. A poor old fellow, very harmless and very
      helpless, who had been set here to watch over you.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must not look upon me as a jailer because of what I say, my child,”
       he added with a quaint air of deference and apology. “I am very old and
      very small, and only take up a very little room. I can make myself very
      scarce; you shall hardly know that I am here. They forced me to it much
      against my will.... But they are strong and I am weak, how could I deny
      them since they put me here. After all,” he concluded naively, “perhaps it
      is the will of le bon Dieu, and He knows best, my child, He knows best.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The shoes evidently refused to respond any further to the old man's
      efforts at polishing them. He contemplated them now, with a whimsical look
      of regret on his furrowed face, then set them down on the floor and
      slipped his stockinged feet into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite was silently watching him, still leaning on her elbow.
      Evidently her brain was still numb and fatigued, for she did not seem able
      to grasp all that the old man said. She smiled to herself too as she
      watched him. How could she look upon him as a jailer? He did not seem at
      all like a Jacobin or a Terrorist, there was nothing of the dissatisfied
      democrat, of the snarling anarchist ready to lend his hand to any act of
      ferocity directed against a so-called aristocrat, about this pathetic
      little figure in the ragged soutane and worn shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed singularly bashful too and ill at ease, and loath to meet
      Marguerite's great, ardent eyes, which were fixed questioningly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must forgive me, my daughter,” he said shyly, “for concluding my
      toilet before you. I had hoped to be quite ready before you woke, but I
      had some trouble with my shoes; except for a little water and soap the
      prison authorities will not provide us poor captives with any means of
      cleanliness and tidiness, and le bon Dieu does love a tidy body as well as
      a clean soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But there, there,” he added fussily, “I must not continue to gossip like
      this. You would like to get up, I know, and refresh your face and hands
      with a little water. Oh! you will see how well I have thought it out. I
      need not interfere with you at all, and when you make your little bit of
      toilette, you will feel quite alone... just as if the old man was not
      there.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He began busying himself about the room, dragging the rickety,
      rush-bottomed chairs forward. There were four of these in the room, and he
      began forming a kind of bulwark with them, placing two side by side, then
      piling the two others up above.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will see, my child, you will see!” he kept repeating at intervals as
      the work of construction progressed. It was no easy matter, for he was of
      low stature, and his hands were unsteady from apparently uncontrollable
      nervousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite, leaning slightly forward, her chin resting in her hand, was
      too puzzled and anxious to grasp the humour of this comical situation. She
      certainly did not understand. This old man had in some sort of way, and
      for a hitherto unexplained reason, been set as a guard over her; it was
      not an unusual device on the part of the inhuman wretches who now ruled
      France, to add to the miseries and terrors of captivity, where a woman of
      refinement was concerned, the galling outrage of never leaving her alone
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That peculiar form of mental torture, surely the invention of brains
      rendered mad by their own ferocious cruelty, was even now being inflicted
      on the hapless, dethroned Queen of France. Marguerite, in far-off England,
      had shuddered when she heard of it, and in her heart had prayed, as indeed
      every pure-minded woman did then, that proud, unfortunate Marie Antoinette
      might soon find release from such torments in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently some similar intention with regard to Marguerite
      herself in the minds of those who now held her prisoner. But this old man
      seemed so feeble and so helpless, his very delicacy of thought as he built
      up a screen to divide the squalid room in two, proved him to be singularly
      inefficient for the task of a watchful jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the four chairs appeared fairly steady, and in comparatively little
      danger of toppling, he dragged the paillasse forward and propped it up
      against the chairs. Finally he drew the table along, which held the
      cracked ewer and basin, and placed it against this improvised partition:
      then he surveyed the whole construction with evident gratification and
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There now!” he said, turning a face beaming with satisfaction to
      Marguerite, “I can continue my prayers on the other side of the fortress.
      Oh! it is quite safe...” he added, as with a fearsome hand he touched his
      engineering feat with gingerly pride, “and you will be quite private....
      Try and forget that the old abbe is in the room.... He does not count...
      really he does not count... he has ceased to be of any moment these many
      months now that Saint Joseph is closed and he may no longer say Mass.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He was obviously prattling on in order to hide his nervous bashfulness. He
      ensconced himself behind his own finely constructed bulwark, drew a
      breviary from his pocket and having found a narrow ledge on one of the
      chairs, on which he could sit, without much danger of bringing the
      elaborate screen onto the top of his head, he soon became absorbed in his
      orisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite watched him for a little while longer: he was evidently
      endeavouring to make her think that he had become oblivious of her
      presence, and his transparent little manoeuvers amused and puzzled her not
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked so comical with his fussy and shy ways, yet withal so gentle and
      so kindly that she felt completely reassured and quite calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to raise herself still further and found the process
      astonishingly easy. Her limbs still ached and the violent, intermittent
      pain in her head certainly made her feel sick and giddy at times, but
      otherwise she was not ill. She sat up on the paillasse, then put her feet
      to the ground and presently walked up to the improvised dressing-room and
      bathed her face and hands. The rest had done her good, and she felt quite
      capable of co-ordinating her thoughts, of moving about without too much
      pain, and of preparing herself both mentally and physically for the grave
      events which she knew must be imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she busied herself with her toilet her thoughts dwelt on the one
      all-absorbing theme: Percy was in Boulogne, he knew that she was here, in
      prison, he would reach her without fail, in fact he might communicate with
      her at any moment now, and had without a doubt already evolved a plan of
      escape for her, more daring and ingenious than any which he had conceived
      hitherto; therefore, she must be ready, and prepared for any eventuality,
      she must be strong and eager, in no way despondent, for if he were here,
      would he not chide her for her want of faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time she had smoothed her hair and tidied her dress, Marguerite
      caught herself singing quite cheerfully to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So full of buoyant hope was she.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XIX: The Strength of the Weak
    </h2>
    <p>
      “M. L'Abbe!...” said Marguerite gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, mon enfant.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked up from his breviary, and saw Marguerite's great
      earnest eyes fixed with obvious calm and trust upon him. She had finished
      her toilet as well as she could, had shaken up and tidied the paillasse,
      and was now sitting on the edge of it, her hands clasped between her
      knees. There was something which still puzzled her, and impatient and
      impulsive as she was, she had watched the abbe as he calmly went on
      reading the Latin prayers for the last five minutes, and now she could
      contain her questionings no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You said just now that they set you to watch over me...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “So they did, my child, so they did...” he replied with a sigh, as he
      quietly closed his book and slipped it back into his pocket. “Ah! they are
      very cunning... and we must remember that they have the power. No doubt,”
       added the old man, with his own, quaint philosophy, “no doubt le bon Dieu
      meant them to have the power, or they would not have it, would they?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “By 'they' you mean the Terrorists and Anarchists of France, M. L'Abbe....
      The Committee of Public Safety who pillage and murder, outrage women, and
      desecrate religion.... Is that not so?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Alas! my child!” he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And it is 'they' who have set you to watch over me?... I confess I don't
      understand...”
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, quite involuntarily indeed, for in spite of the reassurance
      in her heart her brain was still in a whirl of passionate anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don't look at all like one of 'them,' M. l'Abbe,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The good God forbid!” ejaculated the old man, raising protesting hands up
      toward the very distant, quite invisible sky. “How could I, a humble
      priest of the Lord, range myself with those who would flout and defy Him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yet I am a prisoner of the Republic and you are my jailer, M. l'Abbe.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, yes!” he sighed. “But I am very helpless. This was my cell. I had
      been here with Francois and Felicite, my sister's children, you know.
      Innocent lambs, whom those fiends would lead to slaughter. Last night,” he
      continued, speaking volubly, “the soldiers came in and dragged Francois
      and Felicite out of this room, where, in spite of the danger before us, in
      spite of what we suffered, we had contrived to be quite happy together. I
      could read the Mass, and the dear children would say their prayers night
      and morning at my knee.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused awhile. The unshed tears in his mild blue eyes struggled for
      freedom now, and one or two flowed slowly down his wrinkled cheek.
      Marguerite, though heartsore and full of agonizing sorrow herself, felt
      her whole noble soul go out to this kind old man, so pathetic, so high and
      simple-minded in his grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, however, and the Abbe continued after a few seconds'
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When the children had gone, they brought you in here, mon enfant, and
      laid you on the paillasse where Felicite used to sleep. You looked very
      white, and stricken down, like one of God's lambs attacked by the ravening
      wolf. Your eyes were closed and you were blissfully unconscious. I was
      taken before the governor of the prison, and he told me that you would
      share the cell with me for a time, and that I was to watch you night and
      day, because...”
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paused again. Evidently what he had to say was very difficult
      to put into words. He groped in his pockets and brought out a large
      bandana handkerchief, red and yellow and green, with which he began to mop
      his moist forehead. The quaver in his voice and the trembling of his hands
      became more apparent and pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, M. l'Abbe? Because?...” queried Marguerite gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They said that if I guarded you well, Felicite and Francois would be set
      free,” replied the old man after a while, during which he made vigorous
      efforts to overcome his nervousness, “and that if you escaped the children
      and I would be guillotined the very next day.”
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the little room now. The Abbe was sitting quite
      still, clasping his trembling fingers, and Marguerite neither moved nor
      spoke. What the old man had just said was very slowly finding its way to
      the innermost cells of her brain. Until her mind had thoroughly grasped
      the meaning of it all, she could not trust herself to make a single
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some seconds before she fully understood it all, before she
      realized what it meant not only to her, but indirectly to her husband.
      Until now she had not been fully conscious of the enormous wave of hope
      which almost in spite of herself had risen triumphant above the dull, grey
      sea of her former despair; only now when it had been shattered against
      this deadly rock of almost superhuman devilry and cunning did she
      understand what she had hoped, and what she must now completely forswear.
    </p>
    <p>
      No bolts and bars, no fortified towers or inaccessible fortresses could
      prove so effectual a prison for Marguerite Blakeney as the dictum which
      morally bound her to her cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you escape the children and I would be guillotined the very next day.”
     </p>
    <p>
      This meant that even if Percy knew, even if he could reach her, he could
      never set her free, since her safety meant death to two innocent children
      and to this simple hearted man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would require more than the ingenuity of the Scarlet Pimpernel himself
      to untie this Gordian knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don't mind for myself, of course,” the old man went on with gentle
      philosophy. “I have lived my life. What matters if I die to-morrow, or if
      I linger on until my earthly span is legitimately run out? I am ready to
      go home whenever my Father calls me. But it is the children, you see. I
      have to think of them. Francois is his mother's only son, the bread-winner
      of the household, a good lad and studious too, and Felicite has always
      been very delicate. She is blind from birth and...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! don't... for pity's sake, don't...” moaned Marguerite in an agony of
      helplessness. “I understand... you need not fear for your children, M.
      l'Abbe: no harm shall come to them through me.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is as the good God wills!” replied the old man quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Marguerite had once more relapsed into silence, he fumbled for
      his beads, and his gentle voice began droning the Paters and Aves wherein
      no doubt his child-like heart found peace and solace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood that the poor woman would not wish to speak, he knew as well
      as she did the overpowering strength of his helpless appeal. Thus the
      minutes sped on, the jailer and the captive, tied to one another by the
      strongest bonds that hand of man could forge, had nothing to say to one
      another: he, the old priest, imbued with the traditions of his calling,
      could pray and resign himself to the will of the Almighty, but she was
      young and ardent and passionate, she loved and was beloved, and an
      impassable barrier was built up between her and the man she worshipped!
    </p>
    <p>
      A barrier fashioned by the weak hands of children, one of whom was
      delicate and blind. Outside was air and freedom, reunion with her husband,
      an agony of happy remorse, a kiss from his dear lips, and trembling held
      her back from it all, because of Francois who was the bread-winner and of
      Felicite who was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically now Marguerite rose again, and like an automaton—lifeless
      and thoughtless—she began putting the dingy, squalid room to rights.
      The Abbe helped her demolish the improvised screen; with the same gentle
      delicacy of thought which had caused him to build it up, he refrained from
      speaking to her now: he would not intrude himself on her grief and her
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, she forced herself to speak again, and asked the old man his
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is Foucquet,” he replied, “Jean Baptiste Marie Foucquet, late
      parish priest of the Church of Saint Joseph, the patron saint of
      Boulogne.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Foucquet! This was l'Abbe Foucquet! the faithful friend and servant of the
      de Marny family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite gazed at him with great, questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a wealth of memories crowded in on her mind at sound of that name!
      Her beautiful home at Richmond, her brilliant array of servants and
      guests, His Royal Highness at her side! life in free, joyous happy England—how
      infinitely remote it now seemed. Her ears were filled with the sound of a
      voice, drawly and quaint and gentle, a voice and a laugh half shy, wholly
      mirthful, and oh! so infinitely dear:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think a little sea voyage and English country air would suit the Abbe
      Foucquet, m'dear, and I only mean to ask him to cross the Channel with
      me...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the joy and confidence expressed in those words! the daring, the
      ambition! the pride! and the soft, languorous air of the old-world garden
      round her then, the passion of his embrace! the heavy scent of late roses
      and of heliotrope, which caused her to swoon in his arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a narrow prison cell, and that pathetic, tender little creature
      there, with trembling hands and tear-dimmed eyes, the most powerful and
      most relentless jailer which the ferocious cunning of her deadly enemies
      could possibly have devised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she talked to him of Juliette Marny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe did not know that Mlle. de Marny had succeeded in reaching
      England safely and was overjoyed to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recounted to Marguerite the story of the Marny jewels: how he had put
      them safely away in the crypt of his little church, until the Assembly of
      the Convention had ordered the closing of the churches, and placed before
      every minister of le bon Dieu the alternative of apostasy or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “With me it has only been prison so far,” continued the old man simply,
      “but prison has rendered me just as helpless as the guillotine would have
      done, for the enemies of le bon Dieu have ransacked the Church of Saint
      Joseph and stolen the jewels which I should have guarded with my life.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was obvious joy for the Abbe to talk of Juliette Marny's happiness.
      Vaguely, in his remote little provincial cure, he had heard of the prowess
      and daring of the Scarlet Pimpernel and liked to think that Juliette owed
      her safety to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The good God will reward him and those whom he cares for,” added Abbe
      Foucquet with that earnest belief in divine interference which seemed so
      strangely pathetic under these present circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite sighed, and for the first time in this terrible soul-stirring
      crisis through which she was passing so bravely, she felt a beneficent
      moisture in her eyes: the awful tension of her nerves relaxed. She went up
      to the old man took his wrinkled hand in hers and falling on her knees
      beside him she eased her overburdened heart in a flood of tears.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XX: Triumph
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day that Citizen Chauvelin's letter was received by the members of the
      Committee of Public Safety was indeed one of great rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moniteur tells us that in the Seance of September 22nd, 1793, or
      Vendemiaire 1st of the Year I. it was decreed that sixty prisoners, not
      absolutely proved guilty of treason against the Republic—only
      suspected—were to be set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty!... at the mere news of the possible capture of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee was inclined to be magnanimous. Ferocity yielded for the
      moment to the elusive joy of anticipatory triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      A glorious prize was about to fall into the hands of those who had the
      welfare of the people at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre and his decemvirs rejoiced, and sixty persons had cause to
      rejoice with them. So be it! There were plans evolved already as to
      national fetes and wholesale pardons when that impudent and meddlesome
      Englishman at last got his deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wholesale pardons which could easily be rescinded afterwards. Even with
      those sixty it was a mere respite. Those of le Salut Public only loosened
      their hold for a while, were nobly magnanimous for a day, quite prepared
      to be doubly ferocious the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile let us heartily rejoice!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scarlet Pimpernel is in France or will be very soon, and on an
      appointed day he will present himself conveniently to the soldiers of the
      Republic for capture and for subsequent guillotine. England is at war with
      us, there is nothing therefore further to fear from her. We might hang
      every Englishman we can lay hands on, and England could do no more than
      she is doing at the present moment: bombard our ports, bluster and
      threaten, join hands with Flanders, and Austria and Sardinia, and the
      devil if she choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allons! vogue la galere! The Scarlet Pimpernel is perhaps on our shores at
      this very moment! Our most stinging, most irritating foe is about to be
      delivered into our hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizen Chauvelin's letter is very categorical:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I guarantee to you, Citizen Robespierre, and to the Members of the
      Revolutionary Government who have entrusted me with the delicate
      mission...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre's sensuous lips curl into a sarcastic smile. Citizen
      Chauvelin's pen was ever florid in its style: “entrusted me with the
      delicate mission,” is hardly the way to describe an order given under
      penalty of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      “... that four days from this date, at one hour after sunset, the man who
      goes by the mysterious name of the Scarlet Pimpernel will be on the
      southern ramparts of Boulogne, at the extreme southern corner of the
      town.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Four days from this date...” and Citizen Chauvelin's letter is dated the
      nineteenth of September, 1793.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Too much of an aristocrat—Monsieur le Marquis Chauvelin...” sneers
      Merlin, the Jacobin. “He does not know that all good citizens had called
      that date the 28th Fructidor, Year I. of the Republic.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “No matter,” retorts Robespierre with impatient frigidity, “whatever we
      may call the day it was forty-eight hours ago, and in forty-eight hours
      more that damned Englishman will have run his head into a noose, from
      which, an I mistake not, he'll not find it easy to extricate himself.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And you believe in Citizen Chauvelin's assertion,” commented Danton with
      a lazy shrug of the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Only because he asks for help from us,” quoth Robespierre drily; “he is
      sure that the man will be there, but not sure if he can tackle him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But many were inclined to think that Chauvelin's letter was an idle boast.
      They knew nothing of the circumstances which had caused that letter to be
      written: they could not conjecture how it was that the ex-ambassador could
      be so precise in naming the day and hour when the enemy of France would be
      at the mercy of those whom he had outraged and flouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless Citizen Chauvelin asks for help, and help must not be denied
      him. There must be no shadow of blame upon the actions of the Committee of
      Public Safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had been weak once, had allowed the prize to slip through his
      fingers; it must not occur again. He has a wonderful head for devising
      plans, but he needs a powerful hand to aid him, so that he may not fail
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collot d'Herbois, just home from Lyons and Tours, is the right man in an
      emergency like this. Citizen Collot is full of ideas; the inventor of the
      “Noyades” is sure to find a means of converting Boulogne into one gigantic
      prison out of which the mysterious English adventurer will find it
      impossible to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whilst the deliberations go on, whilst this committee of butchers are
      busy slaughtering in imagination the game they have not yet succeeded in
      bringing down, there comes another messenger from Citizen Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have ridden hard on the other one's heels, and something very
      unexpected and very sudden must have occurred to cause the Citizen to send
      this second note.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time it is curt and to the point. Robespierre unfolds it and reads it
      to his colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have caught the woman—his wife—there may be murder
      attempted against my person, send me some one at once who will carry out
      my instructions in case of my sudden death.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre's lips curl in satisfaction, showing a row of yellowish teeth,
      long and sharp like the fangs of a wolf. A murmur like unto the snarl of a
      pack of hyenas rises round the table, as Chauvelin's letter is handed
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone has guessed the importance of this preliminary capture: “the
      woman—his wife.” Chauvelin evidently thinks much of it, for he
      anticipates an attempt against his life, nay! he is quite prepared for it,
      ready to sacrifice it for the sake of his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who had accused him of weakness?
    </p>
    <p>
      He only thinks of his duty, not of his life; he does not fear for himself,
      only that the fruits of his skill might be jeopardized through
      assassination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well! this English adventurer is capable of any act of desperation to save
      his wife and himself, and Citizen Chauvelin must not be left in the lurch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, Citizen Collot d'Herbois is despatched forthwith to Boulogne to be a
      helpmeet and counsellor to Citizen Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that can humanly be devised must be done to keep the woman
      secure and to set the trap for that elusive Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he is caught the whole of France shall rejoice, and Boulogne, who had
      been instrumental in running the quarry to earth, must be specially
      privileged on that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general amnesty for all prisoners the day the Scarlet Pimpernel is
      captured. A public holiday and a pardon for all natives of Boulogne who
      are under sentence of death: they shall be allowed to find their way to
      the various English boats—trading and smuggling craft—that
      always lie at anchor in the roads there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee of Public Safety feel amazingly magnanimous towards
      Boulogne; a proclamation embodying the amnesty and the pardon is at once
      drawn up and signed by Robespierre and his bloodthirsty Council of Ten, it
      is entrusted to Citizen Collot d'Herbois to be read out at every corner of
      the ramparts as an inducement to the little town to do its level best. The
      Englishman and his wife—captured in Boulogne—will both be
      subsequently brought to Paris, formally tried on a charge of conspiring
      against the Republic and guillotined as English spies, but Boulogne shall
      have the greater glory and shall reap the first and richest reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And armed with the magnanimous proclamation, the orders for general
      rejoicings and a grand local fete, armed also with any and every power
      over the entire city, its municipality, its garrisons, its forts, for
      himself and his colleague Chauvelin, Citizen Collot d'Herbois starts for
      Boulogne forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Needless to tell him not to let the grass grow under his horse's hoofs.
      The capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, though not absolutely an
      accomplished fact, is nevertheless a practical certainty, and no one
      rejoices over this great event more than the man who is to be present and
      see all the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riding and driving, getting what relays of horses or waggons from roadside
      farms that he can, Collot is not likely to waste much time on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is 157 miles to Boulogne by road, and Collot, burning with ambition to
      be in at the death, rides or drives as no messenger of good tidings has
      ever ridden or driven before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He does not stop to eat, but munches chunks of bread and cheese in the
      recess of the lumbering chaise or waggon that bears him along whenever his
      limbs refuse him service and he cannot mount a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chronicles tell us that twenty-four hours after he left Paris,
      half-dazed with fatigue, but ferocious and eager still, he is borne to the
      gates of Boulogne by an old cart horse requisitioned from some distant
      farm, and which falls down, dead, at the Porte Gayole, whilst its rider,
      with a last effort, loudly clamours for admittance into the town “in the
      name of the Republic.”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXI: Suspense
    </h2>
    <p>
      In his memorable interview with Robespierre, the day before he left for
      England, Chauvelin had asked that absolute power be given him, in order
      that he might carry out the plans for the capture of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel, which he had in his mind. Now that he was back in France he had
      no cause to complain that the revolutionary government had grudged him
      this power for which he had asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implicit obedience had followed whenever he had commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he heard that a woman had been arrested in the act of uttering
      a passport in the name of Celine Dumont, he guessed at once that
      Marguerite Blakeney had, with characteristic impulse, fallen into the trap
      which, with the aid of the woman Candeille, he had succeeded in laying for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not the least surprised at that. He knew human nature, feminine
      nature, far too well, ever to have been in doubt for a moment that
      Marguerite would follow her husband without calculating either costs or
      risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ye gods! the irony of it all! Had she not been called the cleverest woman
      in Europe at one time? Chauvelin himself had thus acclaimed her, in those
      olden days, before she and he became such mortal enemies, and when he was
      one of the many satellites that revolved round brilliant Marguerite St.
      Just. And to-night, when a sergeant of the town guards brought him news of
      her capture, he smiled grimly to himself; the cleverest woman in Europe
      had failed to perceive the trap laid temptingly open for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she had betrayed her husband into the hands of those who would
      not let him escape a second time. And now she had done it with her eyes
      open, with loving, passionate heart which ached for self-sacrifice, and
      only succeeded in imperilling the loved one more hopelessly than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant was waiting for orders. Citizen Chauvelin had come to
      Boulogne, armed with more full and more autocratic powers than any servant
      of the new republic had ever been endowed with before. The governor of the
      town, the captain of the guard, the fort and municipality were all as
      abject slaves before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had taken possession of the quarters organized for him in
      the Town Hall, he had asked for a list of prisoners who for one cause or
      another were being detained pending further investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list was long and contained many names which were of not the slightest
      interest to Chauvelin: he passed them over impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be released at once,” he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not want the guard to be burdened with unnecessary duties, nor the
      prisons of the little sea-port town to be inconveniently encumbered. He
      wanted room, space, air, the force and intelligence of the entire town at
      his command for the one capture which meant life and revenge to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A woman—name unknown—found in possession of a forged passport
      in the name of Celine Dumont, maid to the Citizeness Desiree Candeille—attempted
      to land—was interrogated and failed to give satisfactory explanation
      of herself—detained in room No. 6 of the Gayole prison.”
     </p>
    <p>
      This was one of the last names on the list, the only one of any importance
      to Citizen Chauvelin. When he read it he nearly drove his nails into the
      palms of his hands, so desperate an effort did he make not to betray
      before the sergeant by look or sigh the exultation which he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he shaded his eyes against the glare of the lamp, but it was
      not long before he had formulated a plan and was ready to give his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked for a list of prisoners already detained in the various forts.
      The name of l'Abbe Foucquet with those of his niece and nephew attracted
      his immediate attention. He asked for further information respecting these
      people, heard that the boy was a widow's only son, the sole supporter of
      his mother's declining years: the girl was ailing, suffering from
      incipient phthisis, and was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardi! the very thing! L'Abbe himself, the friend of Juliette Marny, the
      pathetic personality around which this final adventure of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel was intended to revolve! and these two young people! his
      sister's children! one of them blind and ill, the other full of vigour and
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizen Chauvelin had soon made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few quick orders to the sergeant of the guard, and l'Abbe Foucquet,
      weak, helpless and gentle, became the relentless jailer who would guard
      Marguerite more securely than a whole regiment of loyal soldiers could
      have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, having despatched a messenger to the Committee of Public Safety,
      Chauvelin laid himself down to rest. Fate had not deceived him. He had
      thought and schemed and planned, and events had shaped themselves exactly
      as foreseen, and the fact that Marguerite Blakeney was at the present
      moment a prisoner in his hands was merely the result of his own
      calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the Scarlet Pimpernel, Chauvelin could not very well conceive what
      he would do under these present circumstances. The duel on the southern
      ramparts had of course become a farce, not likely to be enacted now that
      Marguerite's life was at stake. The daring adventurer was caught in a
      network at last, from which all his ingenuity, all his wit, his impudence
      and his amazing luck could never extricate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Chauvelin's mind there was still something more. Revenge was the
      sweetest emotion his bruised and humbled pride could know: he had not yet
      tasted its complete intoxicating joy: but every hour now his cup of
      delight became more and more full: in a few days it would overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile he was content to wait. The hours sped by and there was
      no news yet of that elusive Pimpernel. Of Marguerite he knew nothing save
      that she was well guarded; the sentry who passed up and down outside room
      No. 6 had heard her voice and that of the Abbe Foucquet, in the course of
      the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had asked the Committee of Public Safety for aid in his
      difficult task, but forty-eight hours at least must elapse before such aid
      could reach him. Forty-eight hours, during which the hand of an assassin
      might be lurking for him, and might even reach him ere his vengeance was
      fully accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the only thought which really troubled him. He did not want to
      die before he had seen the Scarlet Pimpernel a withered abject creature,
      crushed in fame and honour, too debased to find glorification even in
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he only cared for his life because it was needed for the
      complete success of his schemes. No one else he knew would have that note
      of personal hatred towards the enemy of France which was necessary now in
      order to carry out successfully the plans which he had formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robespierre and all the others only desired the destruction of a man who
      had intrigued against the reign of terror which they had established; his
      death on the guillotine, even if it were surrounded with the halo of
      martyrdom, would have satisfied them completely. Chauvelin looked further
      than that. He hated the man! He had suffered humiliation through him
      individually. He wished to see him as an object of contempt rather than of
      pity. And because of the anticipation of this joy, he was careful of his
      life, and throughout those two days which elapsed between the capture of
      Marguerite and the arrival of Collot d'Herbois at Boulogne, Chauvelin
      never left his quarters at the Hotel de Ville, and requisitioned a special
      escort consisting of proved soldiers of the town guard to attend his every
      footstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 22nd, after the arrival of Citizen Collot in
      Boulogne, he gave orders that the woman from No. 6 cell be brought before
      him in the ground floor room of the Fort Gayole.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXII: Not Death
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days of agonizing suspense, of alternate hope and despair, had told
      heavily on Marguerite Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her courage was still indomitable, her purpose firm and her faith secure,
      but she was without the slightest vestige of news, entirely shut off from
      the outside world, left to conjecture, to scheme, to expect and to despond
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Foucquet had tried in his gentle way to be of comfort to her, and
      she in her turn did her very best not to render his position more cruel
      than it already was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A message came to him twice during those forty-eight hours from Francois
      and Felicite, a little note scribbled by the boy, or a token sent by the
      blind girl, to tell the Abbe that the children were safe and well, that
      they would be safe and well so long as the Citizeness with the name
      unknown remained closely guarded by him in room No. 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      When these messages came, the old man would sigh and murmur something
      about the good God: and hope, which perhaps had faintly risen in
      Marguerite's heart within the last hour or so, would once more sink back
      into the abyss of uttermost despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the monotonous walk of the sentry sounded like the perpetual thud
      of a hammer beating upon her bruised temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What's to be done? My God? what's to be done?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Where was Percy now?
    </p>
    <p>
      “How to reach him!... Oh, God! grant me light!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The one real terror which she felt was that she would go mad. Nay! that
      she was in a measure mad already. For hours now,—or was it days?...
      or years?... she had heard nothing save that rhythmic walk of the
      sentinel, and the kindly, tremulous voice of the Abbe whispering
      consolations, or murmuring prayers in her ears, she had seen nothing save
      that prison door, of rough deal, painted a dull grey, with great
      old-fashioned lock, and hinges rusty with the damp of ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had kept her eyes fixed on that door until they burned and ached with
      well-nigh intolerable pain; yet she felt that she could not look
      elsewhere, lest she missed the golden moment when the bolts would be
      drawn, and that dull, grey door would swing slowly on its rusty hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, surely, that was the commencement of madness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet for Percy's sake, because he might want her, because he might have
      need of her courage and of her presence of mind, she tried to keep her
      wits about her. But it was difficult! oh! terribly difficult! especially
      when the shade of evening began to gather in, and peopled the squalid,
      whitewashed room with innumerable threatening ghouls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when the moon came up, a silver ray crept in through the tiny window
      and struck full upon that grey door, making it look weird and spectral
      like the entrance to a house of ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now as there was a distinct sound of the pushing of bolts and bars,
      Marguerite thought that she was the prey of hallucinations. The Abbe
      Foucquet was sitting in the remote and darkest corner of the room, quietly
      telling his beads. His serene philosophy and gentle placidity could in no
      way be disturbed by the opening or shutting of a door, or by the bearer of
      good or evil tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room now seemed strangely gloomy and cavernous, with those deep, black
      shadows all around and that white ray of the moon which struck so weirdly
      on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite shuddered with one of those unaccountable premonitions of
      something evil about to come, which ofttimes assail those who have a
      nervous and passionate temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door swung slowly open upon its hinges: there was a quick word of
      command, and the light of a small oil lamp struck full into the gloom.
      Vaguely Marguerite discerned a group of men, soldiers no doubt, for there
      was a glint of arms and the suggestion of tricolour cockades and scarves.
      One of the men was holding the lamp aloft, another took a few steps
      forward into the room. He turned to Marguerite, entirely ignoring the
      presence of the old priest, and addressed her peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your presence is desired by the citizen governor,” he said curtly; “stand
      up and follow me.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Whither am I to go?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To where my men will take you. Now then, quick's the word. The citizen
      governor does not like to wait.”
     </p>
    <p>
      At a word of command from him, two more soldiers now entered the room and
      placed themselves one on each side of Marguerite, who, knowing that
      resistance was useless, had already risen and was prepared to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe tried to utter a word of protest and came quickly forward towards
      Marguerite, but he was summarily and very roughly pushed aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now then, calotin,” said the first soldier with an oath, “this is none of
      your business. Forward! march!” he added, addressing his men, “and you,
      Citizeness, will find it wiser to come quietly along and not to attempt
      any tricks with me, or the gag and manacles will have to be used.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Marguerite had no intention of resisting. She was too tired even to
      wonder as to what they meant to do with her or whither they were going;
      she moved as in a dream and felt a hope within her that she was being led
      to death: summary executions were the order of the day, she knew that, and
      sighed for this simple solution of the awful problem which had been
      harassing her these past two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was being led along a passage, stumbling ever and anon as she walked,
      for it was but dimly lighted by the same little oil lamp, which one of the
      soldiers was carrying in front, holding it high up above his head: then
      they went down a narrow flight of stone steps, until she and her escort
      reached a heavy oak door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A halt was ordered at this point: and the man in command of the little
      party pushed the door open and walked in. Marguerite caught sight of a
      room beyond, dark and gloomy-looking, as was her own prison cell.
      Somewhere on the left there was obviously a window; she could not see it
      but guessed that it was there because the moon struck full upon the floor,
      ghost-like and spectral, well fitting in with the dream-like state in
      which Marguerite felt herself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the room she could discern a table with a chair close
      beside it, also a couple of tallow candles, which flickered in the draught
      caused no doubt by that open window which she could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these little details impressed themselves on Marguerite's mind, as she
      stood there, placidly waiting until she should once more be told to move
      along. The table, the chair, that unseen window, trivial objects though
      they were, assumed before her overwrought fancy an utterly
      disproportionate importance. She caught herself presently counting up the
      number of boards visible on the floor, and watching the smoke of the
      tallow-candles rising up towards the grimy ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few minutes' weary waiting which seemed endless to Marguerite,
      there came a short word of command from within and she was roughly pushed
      forward into the room by one of the men. The cool air of a late
      September's evening gently fanned her burning temples. She looked round
      her and now perceived that someone was sitting at the table, the other
      side of the tallow-candles—a man, with head bent over a bundle of
      papers and shading his face against the light with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as she approached, and the flickering flame of the candles played
      weirdly upon the slight, sable-clad figure, illumining the keen,
      ferret-like face, and throwing fitful gleams across the deep-set eyes and
      the narrow, cruel mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically Marguerite took the chair which the soldier drew towards her,
      ordering her curtly to sit down. She seemed to have but little power to
      move. Though all her faculties had suddenly become preternaturally alert
      at sight of this man, whose very life now was spent in doing her the most
      grievous wrong that one human being can do to another, yet all these
      faculties were forcefully centred in the one mighty effort not to flinch
      before him, not to let him see for a moment that she was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She compelled her eyes to look at him fully and squarely, her lips not to
      tremble, her very heart to stop its wild, excited beating. She felt his
      keen eyes fixed intently upon her, but more in curiosity than in hatred or
      satisfied vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had sat down he came round the table and moved towards her. When
      he drew quite near, she instinctively recoiled. It had been an almost
      imperceptible action on her part and certainly an involuntary one, for she
      did not wish to betray a single thought or emotion, until she knew what he
      wished to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had noted her movement—a sort of drawing up and stiffening of
      her whole person as he approached. He seemed pleased to see it, for he
      smiled sarcastically but with evident satisfaction, and—as if his
      purpose was now accomplished—he immediately withdrew and went back
      to his former seat on the other side of the table. After that he ordered
      the soldiers to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But remain at attention outside, you and your men,” he added, “ready to
      enter if I call.”
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Marguerite's turn to smile at this obvious sign of a lurking fear
      on Chauvelin's part, and a line of sarcasm and contempt curled her full
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers having obeyed and the oak door having closed upon them,
      Marguerite was now alone with the man whom she hated and loathed beyond
      every living thing on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered when he would begin to speak and why he had sent for her. But
      he seemed in no hurry to begin. Still shading his face with his hand, he
      was watching her with utmost attention: she, on the other hand, was
      looking through and beyond him, with contemptuous indifference, as if his
      presence here did not interest her in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would give him no opening for this conversation which he had sought
      and which she felt would prove either purposeless or else deeply wounding
      to her heart and to her pride. She sat, therefore, quite still with the
      flickering and yellow light fully illumining her delicate face, with its
      child-like curves, and delicate features, the noble, straight brow, the
      great blue eyes and halo of golden hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My desire to see you here to-night, must seem strange to you, Lady
      Blakeney,” said Chauvelin at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as she did not reply, he continued, speaking quite gently, almost
      deferentially:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are various matters of grave importance, which the events of the
      next twenty-four hours will reveal to your ladyship: and believe me that I
      am actuated by motives of pure friendship towards you in this my effort to
      mitigate the unpleasantness of such news as you might hear to-morrow
      perhaps, by giving you due warning of what its nature might be.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned great questioning eyes upon him, and in their expression she
      tried to put all the contempt which she felt, all the bitterness, all the
      defiance and the pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quietly shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! I fear me,” he said, “that your ladyship, as usual doth me grievous
      wrong. It is but natural that you should misjudge me, yet believe me...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A truce on this foolery, M. Chauvelin,” she broke in, with sudden
      impatient vehemence, “pray leave your protestations of friendship and
      courtesy alone, there is no one here to hear them. I pray you proceed with
      what you have to say.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” It was a sigh of satisfaction on the part of Chauvelin. Her anger
      and impatience even at this early stage of the interview proved
      sufficiently that her icy restraint was only on the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Chauvelin always knew how to deal with vehemence. He loved to play
      with the emotions of a passionate fellow-creature: it was only the
      imperturbable calm of a certain enemy of his that was wont to shake his
      own impenetrable armour of reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As your ladyship desires,” he said, with a slight and ironical bow of the
      head. “But before proceeding according to your wish, I am compelled to ask
      your ladyship just one question.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And that is?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Have you reflected what your present position means to that inimitable
      prince of dandies, Sir Percy Blakeney?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Is it necessary for your present purpose, Monsieur, that you should
      mention my husband's name at all?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is indispensable, fair lady,” he replied suavely, “for is not the fate
      of your husband so closely intertwined with yours, that his actions will
      inevitably be largely influenced by your own.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite gave a start of surprise, and as Chauvelin had paused she tried
      to read what hidden meaning lay behind these last words of his. Was it his
      intention then to propose some bargain, one of those terrible
      “either-or's” of which he seemed to possess the malignant secret? Oh! if
      that was so, if indeed he had sent for her in order to suggest one of
      those terrible alternatives of his, then—be it what it may, be it
      the wildest conception which the insane brain of a fiend could invent, she
      would accept it, so long as the man she loved were given one single chance
      of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore she turned to her arch-enemy in a more conciliatory spirit now,
      and even endeavoured to match her own diplomatic cunning against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand,” she said tentatively. “How can my actions influence
      those of my husband? I am a prisoner in Boulogne: he probably is not aware
      of that fact yet and...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir Percy Blakeney may be in Boulogne at any moment now,” he interrupted
      quietly. “An I mistake not, few places can offer such great attractions to
      that peerless gentleman of fashion than doth this humble provincial town
      of France just at this present.... Hath it not the honour of harbouring
      Lady Blakeney within its gates?... And your ladyship may indeed believe me
      when I say that the day that Sir Percy lands in our hospitable port, two
      hundred pairs of eyes will be fixed upon him, lest he should wish to quit
      it again.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And if there were two thousand, sir,” she said impulsively, “they would
      not stop his coming or going as he pleased.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, fair lady,” he said, with a smile, “are you then endowing Sir Percy
      Blakeney with the attributes which, as popular fancy has it, belong
      exclusively to that mysterious English hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A truce to your diplomacy, Monsieur Chauvelin,” she retorted, goaded by
      his sarcasm, “why should we try to fence with one another? What was the
      object of your journey to England? of the farce which you enacted in my
      house, with the help of the woman Candeille? of that duel and that
      challenge, save that you desired to entice Sir Percy Blakeney to France?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And also his charming wife,” he added with an ironical bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip, and made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we say that I succeeded admirably?” he continued, speaking with
      persistent urbanity and calm, “and that I have strong cause to hope that
      the elusive Pimpernel will soon be a guest on our friendly shores?...
      There! you see I too have laid down the foils.... As you say, why should
      we fence? Your ladyship is now in Boulogne, soon Sir Percy will come to
      try and take you away from us, but believe me, fair lady, that it would
      take more than the ingenuity and the daring of the Scarlet Pimpernel
      magnified a thousandfold to get him back to England again... unless...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Unless?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite held her breath. She felt now as if the whole universe must
      stand still during the next supreme moment, until she had heard what
      Chauvelin's next words would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was to be an “unless” then? An “either-or” more terrible no doubt
      than the one he had formulated before her just a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin, she knew, was past master in the art of putting a knife at his
      victim's throat and of giving it just the necessary twist with his cruel
      and relentless “unless”!
    </p>
    <p>
      But she felt quite calm, because her purpose was resolute. There is no
      doubt that during this agonizing moment of suspense she was absolutely
      firm in her determination to accept any and every condition which
      Chauvelin would put before her as the price of her husband's safety. After
      all, these conditions, since he placed them before HER, could resolve
      themselves into questions of her own life against her husband's.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that unreasoning impulse which was one of her most salient
      characteristics, she never paused to think that, to Chauvelin, her own
      life or death were only the means to the great end which he had in view:
      the complete annihilation of the Scarlet Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      That end could only be reached by Percy Blakeney's death—not by her
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now as she was watching him with eyes glowing and lips tightly
      closed, lest a cry of impatient agony should escape her throat, he,—like
      a snail that has shown its slimy horns too soon, and is not ready to face
      the enemy as yet,—seemed suddenly to withdraw within his former
      shell of careless suavity. The earnestness of his tone vanished, giving
      place to light and easy conversation, just as if he were discussing social
      topics with a woman of fashion in a Paris drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay!” he said pleasantly, “is not your ladyship taking this matter in too
      serious a spirit? Of a truth you repeated my innocent word 'unless' even
      as if I were putting knife at your dainty throat. Yet I meant naught that
      need disturb you yet. Have I not said that I am your friend? Let me try
      and prove it to you.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You will find that a difficult task, Monsieur,” she said drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Difficult tasks always have had a great fascination for your humble
      servant. May I try?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Shall we then touch at the root of this delicate matter? Your ladyship,
      so I understand, is at this moment under the impression that I desire to
      encompass—shall I say?—the death of an English gentleman for
      whom, believe me, I have the greatest respect. That is so, is it not?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What is so, M. Chauvelin?” she asked almost stupidly, for truly she had
      not even begun to grasp his meaning. “I do not understand.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You think that I am at this moment taking measures for sending the
      Scarlet Pimpernel to the guillotine? Eh?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I do.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Never was so great an error committed by a clever woman. Your ladyship
      must believe me when I say that the guillotine is the very last place in
      the world where I would wish to see that enigmatic and elusive personage.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Are you trying to fool me, M. Chauvelin? If so, for what purpose? And why
      do you lie to me like that?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “On my honour, 'tis the truth. The death of Sir Percy Blakeney—I may
      call him that, may I not?—would ill suit the purpose which I have in
      view.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What purpose? You must pardon me, Monsieur Chauvelin,” she added with a
      quick, impatient sigh, “but of a truth I am getting confused, and my wits
      must have become dull in the past few days. I pray to you to add to your
      many protestations of friendship a little more clearness in your speech
      and, if possible, a little more brevity. What then is the purpose which
      you had in view when you enticed my husband to come over to France?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “My purpose was the destruction of the Scarlet Pimpernel, not the death of
      Sir Percy Blakeney. Believe me, I have a great regard for Sir Percy. He is
      a most accomplished gentleman, witty, brilliant, an inimitable dandy. Why
      should he not grace with his presence the drawing-rooms of London or of
      Brighton for many years to come?”
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with puzzled inquiry. For one moment the thought flashed
      through her mind that, after all, Chauvelin might be still in doubt as to
      the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel.... But no! that hope was
      madness.... It was preposterous and impossible.... But then, why? why?
      why?... Oh God! for a little more patience!
    </p>
    <p>
      “What I have just said may seem a little enigmatic to your ladyship,” he
      continued blandly, “but surely so clever a woman as yourself, so great a
      lady as is the wife of Sir Percy Blakeney, Baronet, will be aware that
      there are other means of destroying an enemy than the taking of his life.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “For instance, Monsieur Chauvelin?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “There is the destruction of his honour,” he replied slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, bitter laugh, almost hysterical in its loud outburst, broke from
      the very depths of Marguerite's convulsed heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The destruction of his honour!... ha! ha! ha! ha!... of a truth, Monsieur
      Chauvelin, your inventive powers have led you beyond the bounds of
      dreamland!... Ha! ha! ha! ha!... It is in the land of madness that you are
      wandering, sir, when you talk in one breath of Sir Percy Blakeney and the
      possible destruction of his honour!”
     </p>
    <p>
      But he remained apparently quite unruffled, and when her laughter had
      somewhat subsided, he said placidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose from his chair, and once more approached her. This time she
      did not shrink from him. The suggestion which he had made just now, this
      talk of attacking her husband's honour rather than his life, seemed so
      wild and preposterous—the conception truly of a mind unhinged—that
      she looked upon it as a sign of extreme weakness on his part, almost as an
      acknowledgement of impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she watched him as he moved round the table more in curiosity now than
      in fright. He puzzled her, and she still had a feeling at the back of her
      mind that there must be something more definite and more evil lurking at
      the back of that tortuous brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will your ladyship allow me to conduct you to yonder window?” he said,
      “the air is cool, and what I have to say can best be done in sight of
      yonder sleeping city.”
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was one of perfect courtesy, even of respectful deference through
      which not the slightest trace of sarcasm could be discerned, and she,
      still actuated by curiosity and interest, not in any way by fear, quietly
      rose to obey him. Though she ignored the hand which he was holding out
      towards her, she followed him readily enough as he walked up to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through this agonizing and soul-stirring interview she had felt
      heavily oppressed by the close atmosphere of the room, rendered nauseous
      by the evil smell of the smoky tallow-candles which were left to spread
      their grease and smoke abroad unchecked. Once or twice she had gazed
      longingly towards the suggestion of pure air outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin evidently had still much to say to her: the torturing, mental
      rack to which she was being subjected had not yet fully done its work. It
      still was capable of one or two turns, a twist or so which might succeed
      in crushing her pride and her defiance. Well! so be it! she was in the
      man's power: had placed herself therein through her own unreasoning
      impulse. This interview was but one of the many soul-agonies which she had
      been called upon to endure, and if by submitting to it all she could in a
      measure mitigate her own faults and be of help to the man she loved, she
      would find the sacrifice small and the mental torture easy to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore when Chauvelin beckoned to her to draw near, she went up to the
      window, and leaning her head against the deep stone embrasure, she looked
      out into the night.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXIII The Hostage
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chauvelin, without speaking, extended his hand out towards the city as if
      to invite Marguerite to gaze upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite unconscious what hour of the night it might be, but it must
      have been late, for the little town, encircled by the stony arms of its
      forts, seemed asleep. The moon, now slowly sinking in the west, edged the
      towers and spires with filmy lines of silver. To the right Marguerite
      caught sight of the frowning Beffroi, which even as she gazed out began
      tolling its heavy bell. It sounded like the tocsin, dull and muffled.
      After ten strokes it was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten o'clock! At this hour in far-off England, in fashionable London, the
      play was just over, crowds of gaily dressed men and women poured out of
      the open gates of the theatres calling loudly for attendant or chaise.
      Thence to balls or routs, gaily fluttering like so many butterflies,
      brilliant and irresponsible....
    </p>
    <p>
      And in England also, in the beautiful gardens of her Richmond home,
      ofttimes at ten o'clock she had wandered alone with Percy, when he was at
      home, and the spirit of adventure in him momentarily laid to rest. Then,
      when the night was very dark and the air heavy with the scent of roses and
      lilies, she lay quiescent in his arms in that little arbour beside the
      river. The rhythmic lapping of the waves was the only sound that stirred
      the balmy air. He seldom spoke then, for his voice would shake whenever he
      uttered a word: but his impenetrable armour of flippancy was pierced
      through and he did not speak because his lips were pressed to hers, and
      his love had soared beyond the domain of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shudder of intense mental pain went through her now as she gazed on the
      sleeping city, and sweet memories of the past turned to bitterness in this
      agonizing present. One by one as the moon gradually disappeared behind a
      bank of clouds, the towers of Boulogne were merged in the gloom. In front
      of her far, far away, beyond the flat sand dunes, the sea seemed to be
      calling to her with a ghostly and melancholy moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window was on the ground floor of the Fort, and gave direct onto the
      wide and shady walk which runs along the crest of the city walls; from
      where she stood Marguerite was looking straight along the ramparts, some
      thirty metres wide at this point, flanked on either side by the granite
      balustrade, and adorned with a double row of ancient elms stunted and
      twisted into grotesque shapes by the persistent action of the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These wide ramparts are a peculiarity of this city...” said a voice close
      to her ear, “at times of peace they form an agreeable promenade under the
      shade of the trees, and a delightful meeting-place for lovers... or
      enemies....”
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound brought her back to the ugly realities of the present: the
      rose-scented garden at Richmond, the lazily flowing river, the tender
      memories which for that brief moment had confronted her from out a happy
      past, suddenly vanished from her ken. Instead of these the brine-laden
      sea-air struck her quivering nostrils, the echo of the old Beffroi died
      away in her ear, and now from out one of the streets or open places of the
      sleeping city there came the sound of a raucous voice, shooting in
      monotonous tones a string of words, the meaning of which failed to reach
      her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many feet below the window, the southern ramparts of the town
      stretched away into the darkness. She felt unaccountably cold suddenly as
      she looked down upon them and, with aching eyes, tried to pierce the
      gloom. She was shivering in spite of the mildness of this early autumnal
      night: her overwrought fancy was peopling the lonely walls with unearthly
      shapes strolling along, discussing in spectral language a strange duel
      which was to take place here between a noted butcher of men and a mad
      Englishman overfond of adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghouls seemed to pass and repass along in front of her and to be
      laughing audibly because that mad Englishman had been offered his life in
      exchange for his honour. They laughed and laughed, no doubt because he
      refused the bargain—Englishmen were always eccentric, and in these
      days of equality and other devices of a free and glorious revolution,
      honour was such a very marketable commodity that it seemed ridiculous to
      prize it quite so highly. Then they strolled away again and disappeared,
      whilst Marguerite distinctly heard the scrunching of the path beneath
      their feet. She leant forward to peer still further into the darkness, for
      this sound had seemed so absolutely real, but immediately a detaining hand
      was place upon her arm and a sarcastic voice murmured at her elbow:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The result, fair lady, would only be a broken leg or arm; the height is
      not great enough for picturesque suicides, and believe me these ramparts
      are only haunted by ghosts.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back as if a viper had stung her; for the moment she had become
      oblivious of Chauvelin's presence. However, she would not take notice of
      his taunt, and, after a slight pause, he asked her if she could hear the
      town crier over in the public streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What he says at this present moment is of vast importance to your
      ladyship,” he remarked drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How so?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Your ladyship is a precious hostage. We are taking measures to guard our
      valuable property securely.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite thought of the Abbe Foucquet, who no doubt was still quietly
      telling his beads, even if in his heart he had begun to wonder what had
      become of her. She thought of Francois, who was the breadwinner, and of
      Felicite, who was blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Methinks you and your colleagues have done that already,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not as completely as we would wish. We know the daring of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel. We are not even ashamed to admit that we fear his luck, his
      impudence and his marvellous ingenuity.... Have I not told you that I have
      the greatest possible respect for that mysterious English hero.... An old
      priest and two young children might be spirited away by that enigmatical
      adventurer, even whilst Lady Blakeney herself is made to vanish from our
      sight.
     </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! I see your ladyship is taking my simple words as a confession of
      weakness,” he continued, noting the swift sigh of hope which had
      involuntarily escaped her lips. “Nay! and it please you, you shall despise
      me for it. But a confession of weakness is the first sign of strength. The
      Scarlet Pimpernel is still at large, and whilst we guard our hostage
      securely, he is bound to fall into our hands.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! still at large!” she retorted with impulsive defiance. “Think you
      that all your bolts and bars, the ingenuity of yourself and your
      colleagues, the collaboration of the devil himself, would succeed in
      outwitting the Scarlet Pimpernel, now that his purpose will be to try and
      drag ME from out your clutches.”
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt hopeful and proud. Now that she had the pure air of heaven in her
      lungs, that from afar she could smell the sea, and could feel that perhaps
      in a straight line of vision from where she stood, the “Day-Dream” with
      Sir Percy on board, might be lying out there in the roads, it seemed
      impossible that he should fail in freeing her and those poor people—an
      old man and two children—whose lives depended on her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chauvelin only laughed a dry, sarcastic laugh and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hm! perhaps not!... It of course will depend on you and your
      personality... your feelings in such matters... and whether an English
      gentleman likes to save his own skin at the expense of others.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite shivered as if from cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! I see,” resumed Chauvelin quietly, “that your ladyship has not quite
      grasped the position. That public crier is a long way off: the words have
      lingered on the evening breeze and have failed to reach your brain. Do you
      suppose that I and my colleagues do not know that all the ingenuity of
      which the Scarlet Pimpernel is capable will now be directed in piloting
      Lady Blakeney, and incidentally the Abbe Foucquet with his nephew and
      niece, safely across the Channel! Four people!... Bah! a bagatelle, for
      this mighty conspirator, who but lately snatched twenty aristocrats from
      the prisons of Lyons.... Nay! nay! two children and an old man were not
      enough to guard our precious hostage, and I was not thinking of either the
      Abbe Foucquet or of the two children, when I said that an English
      gentleman would not save himself at the expense of others.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Of whom then were you thinking, Monsieur Chauvelin? Whom else have you
      set to guard the prize which you value so highly?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “The whole city of Boulogne,” he replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I do not understand.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Let me make my point clear. My colleague, Citizen Collot d'Herbois, rode
      over from Paris yesterday; like myself he is a member of the Committee of
      Public Safety whose duty it is to look after the welfare of France by
      punishing all those who conspire against her laws and the liberties of the
      people. Chief among these conspirators, whom it is our duty to punish is,
      of course, that impudent adventurer who calls himself the Scarlet
      Pimpernel. He has given the government of France a great deal of trouble
      through his attempts—mostly successful, as I have already admitted,—at
      frustrating the just vengeance which an oppressed country has the right to
      wreak on those who have proved themselves to be tyrants and traitors.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Is it necessary to recapitulate all this, Monsieur Chauvelin?” she asked
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think so,” he replied blandly. “You see, my point is this. We feel that
      in a measure now the Scarlet Pimpernel is in our power. Within the next
      few hours he will land at Boulogne... Boulogne, where he has agreed to
      fight a duel with me... Boulogne, where Lady Blakeney happens to be at
      this present moment... as you see, Boulogne has a great responsibility to
      bear: just now she is to a certain extent the proudest city in France,
      since she holds within her gates a hostage for the appearance on our
      shores of her country's most bitter enemy. But she must not fall from that
      high estate. Her double duty is clear before her: she must guard Lady
      Blakeney and capture the Scarlet Pimpernel; if she fail in the former she
      must be punished, if she succeed in the latter she shall be rewarded.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and leaned out of the window again, whilst she watched him,
      breathless and terrified. She was beginning to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hark!” he said, looking straight at her. “Do you hear the crier now? He
      is proclaiming the punishment and the reward. He is making it clear to the
      citizens of Boulogne that on the day when the Scarlet Pimpernel falls into
      the hands of the Committee of Public Safety a general amnesty will be
      granted to all natives of Boulogne who are under arrest at the present
      time, and a free pardon to all those who, born within these city walls,
      are to-day under sentence of death.... A noble reward, eh? well-deserved
      you'll admit.... Should you wonder then if the whole town of Boulogne were
      engaged just now in finding that mysterious hero, and delivering him into
      our hands?... How many mothers, sisters, wives, think you, at the present
      moment, would fail to lay hands on the English adventurer, if a husband's
      or a son's life or freedom happened to be at stake?... I have some records
      there,” he continued, pointing in the direction of the table, “which tell
      me that there are five and thirty natives of Boulogne in the local
      prisons, a dozen more in the prisons of Paris; of these at least twenty
      have been tried already and are condemned to death. Every hour that the
      Scarlet Pimpernel succeeds in evading his captors so many deaths lie at
      his door. If he succeeds in once more reaching England safely three score
      lives mayhap will be the price of his escape.... Nay! but I see your
      ladyship is shivering with cold...” he added with a dry little laugh,
      “shall I close the window? or do you wish to hear what punishment will be
      meted out to Boulogne, if on the day that the Scarlet Pimpernel is
      captured, Lady Blakeney happens to have left the shelter of these city
      walls?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I pray you proceed, Monsieur,” she rejoined with perfect calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Committee of Public Safety,” he resumed, “would look upon this city
      as a nest of traitors if on the day that the Scarlet Pimpernel becomes our
      prisoner Lady Blakeney herself, the wife of that notorious English spy,
      had already quitted Boulogne. The whole town knows by now that you are in
      our hands—you, the most precious hostage we can hold for the
      ultimate capture of the man whom we all fear and detest. Virtually the
      town-crier is at the present moment proclaiming to the inhabitants of this
      city: 'We want that man, but we already have his wife, see to it,
      citizens, that she does not escape! for if she do, we shall summarily
      shoot the breadwinner in every family in the town!'”
     </p>
    <p>
      A cry of horror escaped Marguerite's parched lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Are you devils then, all of you,” she gasped, “that you should think of
      such things?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! some of us are devils, no doubt,” said Chauvelin drily; “but why
      should you honour us in this case with so flattering an epithet? We are
      mere men striving to guard our property and mean no harm to the citizens
      of Boulogne. We have threatened them, true! but is it not for you and that
      elusive Pimpernel to see that the threat is never put into execution?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You would not do it!” she repeated, horror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! I pray you, fair lady, do not deceive yourself. At present the
      proclamation sounds like a mere threat, I'll allow, but let me assure you
      that if we fail to capture the Scarlet Pimpernel and if you on the other
      hand are spirited out of this fortress by that mysterious adventurer we
      shall undoubtedly shoot or guillotine every able-bodied man and woman in
      this town.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He had spoken quietly and emphatically, neither with bombast, nor with
      rage, and Marguerite saw in his face nothing but a calm and ferocious
      determination, the determination of an entire nation embodied in this one
      man, to be revenged at any cost. She would not let him see the depth of
      her despair, nor would she let him read in her face the unutterable
      hopelessness which filled her soul. It were useless to make an appeal to
      him: she knew full well that from him she could obtain neither gentleness
      nor mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope at last I have made the situation quite clear to your ladyship?”
       he was asking quite pleasantly now. “See how easy is your position: you
      have but to remain quiescent in room No. 6, and if any chance of escape be
      offered you ere the Scarlet Pimpernel is captured, you need but to think
      of all the families of Boulogne, who would be deprived of their
      breadwinner—fathers and sons mostly, but there are girls too, who
      support their mothers or sisters; the fish curers of Boulogne are mostly
      women, and there are the net-makers and the seamstresses, all would suffer
      if your ladyship were no longer to be found in No. 6 room of this ancient
      fort, whilst all would be included in the amnesty if the Scarlet Pimpernel
      fell into our hands...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a low, satisfied chuckle which made Marguerite think of the evil
      spirits in hell exulting over the torments of unhappy lost souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think, Lady Blakeney,” he added drily and making her an ironical bow,
      “that your humble servant hath outwitted the elusive hero at last.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Quietly he turned on his heel and went back into the room, Marguerite
      remaining motionless beside the open window, where the soft, brine-laden
      air, the distant murmur of the sea, the occasional cry of a sea-mew, all
      seemed to mock her agonizing despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the town-crier came nearer and nearer now: she could hear the
      words he spoke quite distinctly: something about “amnesty” and pardon, the
      reward for the capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the lives of men, women
      and children in exchange for his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! she knew what all that meant! that Percy would not hesitate one single
      instant to throw his life into the hands of his enemies, in exchange for
      that of others. Others! others! always others! this sigh that had made her
      heart ache so often in England, what terrible significance it bore now!
    </p>
    <p>
      And how he would suffer in his heart and in his pride, because of her whom
      he could not even attempt to save since it would mean the death of others!
      of others, always of others!
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if he had already landed in Boulogne! Again she remembered
      the vision on the landing stage: his massive figure, the glimpse she had
      of the loved form, in the midst of the crowd!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he entered the town he would hear the proclamation read, see it
      posted up no doubt on every public building, and realize that she had been
      foolish enough to follow him, that she was a prisoner and that he could do
      nothing to save her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would he do? Marguerite at the thought instinctively pressed her
      hands to her heart, the agony of it all had become physically painful. She
      hoped that perhaps this pain meant approaching death! oh! how easy would
      this simple solution be!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon peered out from beneath the bank of clouds which had obscured her
      for so long; smiling, she drew her pencilled silver lines along the edge
      of towers and pinnacles, the frowning Beffroi and those stony walls which
      seemed to Marguerite as if they encircled a gigantic graveyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town-crier had evidently ceased to read the proclamation. One by one
      the windows in the public square were lighted up from within. The citizens
      of Boulogne wanted to think over the strange events which had occurred
      without their knowledge, yet which were apparently to have such direful or
      such joyous consequences for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man to be captured! the mysterious English adventurer of whom they had
      all heard, but whom nobody had seen. And a woman—his wife—to
      be guarded until the man was safely under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite felt as if she could almost hear them talking it over and
      vowing that she should not escape, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel should
      soon be captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentle wind stirred the old gnarled trees on the southern ramparts, a
      wind that sounded like the sigh of swiftly dying hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Percy do now? His hands were tied, and he was inevitably
      destined to endure the awful agony of seeing the woman he loved die a
      terrible death beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having captured him, they would not keep him long; no necessity for a
      trial, for detention, for formalities of any kind. A summary execution at
      dawn on the public place, a roll of drums, a public holiday to mark the
      joyful event, and a brave man will have ceased to live, a noble heart have
      stilled its beatings forever, whilst a whole nation gloried over the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Sleep, citizens of Boulogne! all is still!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The night watchman had replaced the town-crier. All was quiet within the
      city walls: the inhabitants could sleep in peace, a beneficent government
      was wakeful and guarding their rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But many of the windows of the town remained lighted up, and at a little
      distance below her, round the corner so that she could not see it, a small
      crowd must have collected in front of the gateway which led into the
      courtyard of the Gayole Fort. Marguerite could hear a persistent murmur of
      voices, mostly angry and threatening, and once there were loud cries of:
      “English spies,” and “a la lanterne!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “The citizens of Boulogne are guarding the treasures of France!” commented
      Chauvelin drily, as he laughed again, that cruel, mirthless laugh of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she roused herself from her torpor: she did not know how long she had
      stood beside the open window, but the fear seized her that that man must
      have seen and gloated over the agony of her mind. She straightened her
      graceful figure, threw back her proud head defiantly, and quietly walked
      up to the table, where Chauvelin seemed once more absorbed in the perusal
      of his papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is this interview over?” she asked quietly, and without the slightest
      tremor in her voice. “May I go now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “As soon as you wish,” he replied with gentle irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her with obvious delight, for truly she was beautiful: grand
      in this attitude of defiant despair. The man, who had spent the last
      half-hour in martyrizing her, gloried over the misery which he had
      wrought, and which all her strength of will could not entirely banish from
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will you believe me, Lady Blakeney?” he added, “that there is no personal
      animosity in my heart towards you or your husband? Have I not told you
      that I do not wish to compass his death?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yet you propose to send him to the guillotine as soon as you have laid
      hands on him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I have explained to you the measures which I have taken in order to make
      sure that we DO lay hands on the Scarlet Pimpernel. Once he is in our
      power, it will rest with him to walk to the guillotine or to embark with
      you on board his yacht.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You propose to place an alternative before Sir Percy Blakeney?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “To offer him his life?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And that of his charming wife.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “In exchange for what?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “His honour.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “He will refuse, Monsieur.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “We shall see.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he touched a handbell which stood on the table, and within a few
      seconds the door was opened and the soldier who had led Marguerite hither,
      re-entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview was at an end. It had served its purpose. Marguerite knew
      now that she must not even think of escape for herself, or hope for safety
      for the man she loved. Of Chauvelin's talk of a bargain which would touch
      Percy's honour she would not even think: and she was too proud to ask
      anything further from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin stood up and made her a deep bow, as she crossed the room and
      finally went out of the door. The little company of soldiers closed in
      around her and she was once more led along the dark passages, back to her
      own prison cell.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXIV: Colleagues
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as the door had closed behind Marguerite, there came from
      somewhere in the room the sound of a yawn, a grunt and a volley of oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flickering light of the tallow candles had failed to penetrate into
      all the corners, and now from out one of these dark depths, a certain
      something began to detach itself, and to move forward towards the table at
      which Chauvelin had once more resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has the damned aristocrat gone at last?” queried a hoarse voice, as a
      burly body clad in loose-fitting coat and mud-stained boots and breeches
      appeared within the narrow circle of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” replied Chauvelin curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And a cursed long time you have been with the baggage,” grunted the other
      surlily. “Another five minutes and I'd have taken the matter in my own
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      “An assumption of authority,” commented Chauvelin quietly, “to which your
      position here does not entitle you, Citizen Collot.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Collot d'Herbois lounged lazily forward, and presently he threw his
      ill-knit figure into the chair lately vacated by Marguerite. His heavy,
      square face bore distinct traces of the fatigue endured in the past
      twenty-four hours on horseback or in jolting market waggons. His temper
      too appeared to have suffered on the way, and, at Chauvelin's curt and
      dictatorial replies, he looked as surly as a chained dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You were wasting your breath over that woman,” he muttered, bringing a
      large and grimy fist heavily down on the table, “and your measures are not
      quite so sound as your fondly imagine, Citizen Chauvelin.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “They were mostly of your imagining, Citizen Collot,” rejoined the other
      quietly, “and of your suggestion.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I added a touch of strength and determination to your mild milk-and-water
      notions, Citizen,” snarled Collot spitefully. “I'd have knocked that
      intriguing woman's brains out at the very first possible opportunity, had
      I been consulted earlier than this.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Quite regardless of the fact that such violent measures would completely
      damn all our chances of success as far as the capture of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel is concerned,” remarked Chauvelin drily, with a contemptuous
      shrug of the shoulders. “Once his wife is dead, the Englishman will never
      run his head into the noose which I have so carefully prepared for him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “So you say, Chauvelin; and therefore I suggested to you certain measures
      to prevent the woman escaping which you will find adequate, I hope.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You need have no fear, Citizen Collot,” said Chauvelin curtly, “this
      woman will make no attempt at escape now.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “If she does...” and Collot d'Herbois swore an obscene oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think she understands that we mean to put our threat in execution.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Threat?... It was no empty threat, Citizen.... Sacre tonnerre! if that
      woman escapes now, by all the devils in hell I swear that I'll wield the
      guillotine myself and cut off the head of every able-bodied man or woman
      in Boulogne, with my own hands.”
     </p>
    <p>
      As he said this his face assumed such an expression of inhuman cruelty,
      such a desire to kill, such a savage lust for blood, that instinctively
      Chauvelin shuddered and shrank away from his colleague. All through his
      career there is no doubt that this man, who was of gentle birth, of gentle
      breeding, and who had once been called M. le Marquis de Chauvelin, must
      have suffered in his susceptibilities and in his pride when in contact
      with the revolutionaries with whom he had chosen to cast his lot. He could
      not have thrown off all his old ideas of refinement quite so easily, as to
      feel happy in the presence of such men as Collot d'Herbois, or Marat in
      his day—men who had become brute beasts, more ferocious far than any
      wild animal, more scientifically cruel than any feline prowler in jungle
      or desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      One look in Collot's distorted face was sufficient at this moment to
      convince Chauvelin that it were useless for him to view the proclamation
      against the citizens of Boulogne merely as an idle threat, even if he had
      wished to do so. That Marguerite would not, under the circumstances,
      attempt to escape, that Sir Percy Blakeney himself would be forced to give
      up all thoughts of rescuing her, was a foregone conclusion in Chauvelin's
      mind, but if this high-born English gentleman had not happened to be the
      selfless hero that he was, if Marguerite Blakeney were cast in a
      different, a rougher mould—if, in short, the Scarlet Pimpernel in
      the face of the proclamation did succeed in dragging his wife out of the
      clutches of the Terrorists, then it was equally certain that Collot
      d'Herbois would carry out his rabid and cruel reprisals to the full. And
      if in the course of the wholesale butchery of the able-bodied and
      wage-earning inhabitants of Boulogne, the headsman should sink worn out,
      then would this ferocious sucker of blood put his own hand to the
      guillotine, with the same joy and lust which he had felt when he ordered
      one hundred and thirty-eight women of Nantes to be stripped naked by the
      soldiery before they were flung helter-skelter into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      A touch of strength and determination! Aye! Citizen Collot d'Herbois had
      plenty of that. Was it he, or Carriere who at Arras commanded mothers to
      stand by while their children were being guillotined? And surely it was
      Maignet, Collot's friend and colleague, who at Bedouin, because the Red
      Flag of the Republic had been mysteriously torn down over night, burnt the
      entire little village down to the last hovel and guillotined every one of
      the three hundred and fifty inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Chauvelin knew all that. Nay, more! he was himself a member of that
      so-called government which had countenanced these butcheries, by giving
      unlimited powers to men like Collot, like Maignet and Carriere. He was at
      one with them in their republican ideas and he believed in the
      regeneration and the purification of France, through the medium of the
      guillotine, but he propounded his theories and carried out his most
      bloodthirsty schemes with physically clean hands and in an immaculately
      cut coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now when Collot d'Herbois lounged before him, with mud-bespattered
      legs stretched out before him, with dubious linen at neck and wrists, and
      an odour of rank tobacco and stale, cheap wine pervading his whole
      personality, the more fastidious man of the world, who had consorted with
      the dandies of London and Brighton, winced at the enforced proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the joint characteristic of all these men who had turned France
      into a vast butchery and charnel-house, that they all feared and hated one
      another, even more whole-heartedly than they hated the aristocrats and
      so-called traitors whom they sent to the guillotine. Citizen Lebon is said
      to have dipped his sword into the blood which flowed from the guillotine,
      whilst exclaiming: “Comme je l'aime ce sang coule de traitre!” but he and
      Collot and Danton and Robespierre, all of them in fact would have regarded
      with more delight still the blood of any one of their colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very moment Collot d'Herbois and Chauvelin would with utmost
      satisfaction have denounced, one the other, to the tender mercies of the
      Public Prosecutor. Collot made no secret of his hatred for Chauvelin, and
      the latter disguised it but thinly under the veneer of contemptuous
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As for that dammed Englishman,” added Collot now, after a slight pause,
      and with another savage oath, “if 'tis my good fortune to lay hands on
      him, I'd shoot him then and there like a mad dog, and rid France once and
      forever of this accursed spy.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And think you, Citizen Collot,” rejoined Chauvelin with a shrug of the
      shoulders, “that France would be rid of all English adventurers by the
      summary death of this one man?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “He is the ringleader, at any rate...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And has at least nineteen disciples to continue his traditions of
      conspiracy and intrigue. None perhaps so ingenuous as himself, none with
      the same daring and good luck perhaps, but still a number of ardent fools
      only too ready to follow in the footsteps of their chief. Then there's the
      halo of martyrdom around the murdered hero, the enthusiasm created by his
      noble death... Nay! nay, Citizen, you have not lived among these English
      people, you do not understand them, or you would not talk of sending their
      popular hero to an honoured grave.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Collot d'Herbois only shook his powerful frame like some big, sulky
      dog, and spat upon the floor to express his contempt of this wild talk
      which seemed to have no real tangible purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have not caught your Scarlet Pimpernel yet, Citizen,” he said with a
      snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, but I will, after sundown to-morrow.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “How do you know?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I have ordered the Angelus to be rung at one of the closed churches, and
      he agreed to fight a duel with me on the southern ramparts at that hour
      and on that day,” said Chauvelin simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You take him for a fool?” sneered Collot.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, only for a foolhardy adventurer.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You imagine that with his wife as hostage in our hands, and the whole
      city of Boulogne on the lookout for him for the sake of the amnesty, that
      the man would be fool enough to walk on those ramparts at a given hour,
      for the express purpose of getting himself caught by you and your men?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am quite sure that if we do not lay hands on him before that given
      hour, that he will be on the ramparts at the Angelus to-morrow,” said
      Chauvelin emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collot shrugged his broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Is the man mad?” he asked with an incredulous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I think so,” rejoined the other with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And having caught your hare,” queried Collot, “how do you propose to cook
      him?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Twelve picked men will be on the ramparts ready to seize him the moment
      he appears.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And to shoot him at sight, I hope.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Only as a last resource, for the Englishman is powerful and may cause our
      half-famished men a good deal of trouble. But I want him alive, if
      possible...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why? a dead lion is safer than a live one any day.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! we'll kill him right enough, Citizen. I pray you have no fear. I hold
      a weapon ready for that meddlesome Scarlet Pimpernel, which will be a
      thousand times more deadly and more effectual than a chance shot, or even
      a guillotine.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What weapon is that, Citizen Chauvelin?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin leaned forward across the table and rested his chin in his
      hands; instinctively Collot too leaned towards him, and both men peered
      furtively round them as if wondering if prying eyes happened to be lurking
      round. It was Chauvelin's pale eyes which now gleamed with hatred and with
      an insatiable lust for revenge at least as powerful as Collot's lust for
      blood; the unsteady light of the tallow candles threw grotesque shadows
      across his brows, and his mouth was set in such rigid lines of implacable
      cruelty that the brutish sot beside him gazed on him amazed, vaguely
      scenting here a depth of feeling which was beyond his power to comprehend.
      He repeated his question under his breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      “What weapon do you mean to use against that accursed spy, Citizen
      Chauvelin?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Dishonour and ridicule!” replied the other quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “In exchange for his life and that of his wife.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “As the woman told you just now... he will refuse.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “We shall see, Citizen.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You are mad to think such things, Citizen, and ill serve the Republic by
      sparing her bitterest foe.”
     </p>
    <p>
      A long, sarcastic laugh broke from Chauvelin's parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Spare him?—spare the Scarlet Pimpernel!...” he ejaculated. “Nay,
      Citizen, you need have no fear of that. But believe me, I have schemes in
      my head by which the man whom we all hate will be more truly destroyed
      than your guillotine could ever accomplish: schemes, whereby the hero who
      is now worshipped in England as a demi-god will suddenly become an object
      of loathing and of contempt.... Ah! I see you understand me now... I wish
      to so cover him with ridicule that the very name of the small wayside
      flower will become a term of derision and of scorn. Only then shall we be
      rid of these pestilential English spies, only then will the entire League
      of the Scarlet Pimpernel become a thing of the past when its whilom
      leader, now thought akin to a god, will have found refuge in a suicide's
      grave, from the withering contempt of the entire world.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had spoken low, hardly above a whisper, and the echo of his last
      words died away in the great, squalid room like a long-drawn-out sigh.
      There was dead silence for a while save for the murmur in the wind outside
      and from the floor above the measured tread of the sentinel guarding the
      precious hostage in No. 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men were staring straight in front of them. Collot d'Herbois
      incredulous, half-contemptuous, did not altogether approve of these
      schemes which seemed to him wild and uncanny: he liked the direct
      simplicity of a summary trial, of the guillotine, or of his own well
      stage-managed “Noyades.” He did not feel that any ridicule or dishonour
      would necessarily paralyze a man in his efforts at intrigue, and would
      have liked to set Chauvelin's authority aside, to behead the woman
      upstairs and then to take his chances of capturing the man later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the orders of the Committee of Public Safety had been peremptory: he
      was to be Chauvelin's help—not his master, and to obey in all
      things. He did not dare to take any initiative in the matter, for in that
      case, if he failed, the reprisals against him would indeed be terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fairly satisfied now that Chauvelin had accepted his suggestion of
      summarily sending to the guillotine one member of every family resident in
      Boulogne, if Marguerite succeeded in effecting an escape, and, of a truth,
      Chauvelin had hailed the fiendish suggestion with delight. The old abbe
      with his nephew and niece were undoubtedly not sufficient deterrents
      against the daring schemes of the Scarlet Pimpernel, who, as a matter of
      fact, could spirit them out of Boulogne just as easily as he would his own
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collot's plan tied Marguerite to her own prison cell more completely than
      any other measure could have done, more so indeed than the originator
      thereof knew or believed.... A man like this d'Herbois—born in the
      gutter, imbued with every brutish tradition, which generations of
      jail-birds had bequeathed to him,—would not perhaps fully realize
      the fact that neither Sir Percy nor Marguerite Blakeney would ever save
      themselves at the expense of others. He had merely made the suggestion,
      because he felt that Chauvelin's plans were complicated and obscure, and
      above all insufficient, and that perhaps after all the English adventurer
      and his wife would succeed in once more outwitting him, when there would
      remain the grand and bloody compensation of a wholesale butchery in
      Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chauvelin was quite satisfied. He knew that under present
      circumstances neither Sir Percy nor Marguerite would make any attempt to
      escape. The ex-ambassador had lived in England: he understood the class to
      which these two belonged, and was quite convinced that no attempt would be
      made on either side to get Lady Blakeney away whilst the present ferocious
      order against the bread-winner of every family in the town held good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye! the measures were sound enough. Chauvelin was easy in his mind about
      that. In another twenty-four hours he would hold the man completely in his
      power who had so boldly outwitted him last year; to-night he would sleep
      in peace: an entire city was guarding the precious hostage.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We'll go to bed now, Citizen,” he said to Collot, who, tired and sulky,
      was moodily fingering the papers on the table. The scraping sound which he
      made thereby grated on Chauvelin's overstrung nerves. He wanted to be
      alone, and the sleepy brute's presence here jarred on his own solemn mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his satisfaction, Collot grunted a surly assent. Very leisurely he rose
      from his chair, stretched out his loose limbs, shook himself like a shaggy
      cur, and without uttering another word he gave his colleague a curt nod,
      and slowly lounged out of the room.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXV: The Unexpected
    </h2>
    <p>
      Chauvelin heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction when Collot d'Herbois finally
      left him to himself. He listened for awhile until the heavy footsteps died
      away in the distance, then leaning back in his chair, he gave himself over
      to the delights of the present situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite in his power. Sir Percy Blakeney compelled to treat for her
      rescue if he did not wish to see her die a miserable death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! my elusive hero,” he muttered to himself, “methinks that we shall be
      able to cry quits at last.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside everything had become still. Even the wind in the trees out there
      on the ramparts had ceased their melancholy moaning. The man was alone
      with his thoughts. He felt secure and at peace, sure of victory, content
      to await the events of the next twenty-four hours. The other side of the
      door the guard which he had picked out from amongst the more feeble and
      ill-fed garrison of the little city for attendance on his own person were
      ranged ready to respond to his call.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dishonour and ridicule! Derision and scorn!” he murmured, gloating over
      the very sound of these words, which expressed all that he hoped to
      accomplish, “utter abjections, then perhaps a suicide's grave...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He loved the silence around him, for he could murmur these words and hear
      them echoing against the bare stone walls like the whisperings of all the
      spirits of hate which were waiting to lend him their aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long he had remained thus absorbed in his meditations, he could not
      afterwards have said; a minute or two perhaps at most, whilst he leaned
      back in his chair with eyes closed, savouring the sweets of his own
      thoughts, when suddenly the silence was interrupted by a loud and pleasant
      laugh and a drawly voice speaking in merry accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The lud live you, Monsieur Chaubertin, and pray how do you propose to
      accomplish all these pleasant things?”
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Chauvelin was on his feet and with eyes dilated, lips parted
      in awed bewilderment, he was gazing towards the open window, where astride
      upon the sill, one leg inside the room, the other out, and with the moon
      shining full on his suit of delicate-coloured cloth, his wide caped coat
      and elegant chapeau-bras, sat the imperturbable Sir Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I heard you muttering such pleasant words, Monsieur,” continued Blakeney
      calmly, “that the temptation seized me to join in the conversation. A man
      talking to himself is ever in a sorry plight... he is either a mad man or
      a fool...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed his own quaint and inane laugh and added apologetically:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Far be if from me, sir, to apply either epithet to you... demmed bad form
      calling another fellow names... just when he does not quite feel himself,
      eh?... You don't feel quite yourself, I fancy just now... eh, Monsieur
      Chaubertin... er... beg pardon, Chauvelin...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat there quite comfortably, one slender hand resting on the
      gracefully-fashioned hilt of his sword—the sword of Lorenzo Cenci,—the
      other holding up the gold-rimed eyeglass through which he was regarding
      his avowed enemy; he was dressed as for a ball, and his perpetually
      amiable smile lurked round the corners of his firm lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had undoubtedly for the moment lost his presence of mind. He did
      not even think of calling to his picked guard, so completely taken aback
      was he by this unforeseen move on the part of Sir Percy. Yet, obviously,
      he should have been ready for this eventuality. Had he not caused the
      town-crier to loudly proclaim throughout the city that if ONE female
      prisoner escaped from Fort Gayole the entire able-bodied population of
      Boulogne would suffer?
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment Sir Percy entered the gates of the town, he could not help but
      hear the proclamation, and hear at the same time that this one female
      prisoner who was so precious a charge, was the wife of the English spy:
      the Scarlet Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, was it not a fact that whenever or wherever the Scarlet
      Pimpernel was least expected there and then would he surely appear? Having
      once realized that it was his wife who was incarcerated in Fort Gayole,
      was it not natural that he would go and prowl around the prison, and along
      the avenue on the summit of the southern ramparts, which was accessible to
      every passer-by? No doubt he had lain in hiding among the trees, had
      perhaps caught snatches of Chauvelin's recent talk with Collot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye! it was all so natural, so simple! Strange that it should have been so
      unexpected!
    </p>
    <p>
      Furious at himself for his momentary stupor, he now made a vigorous effort
      to face his impudent enemy with the same sang-froid of which the latter
      had so inexhaustible a fund.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked quietly towards the window, compelling his nerves to perfect
      calm and his mood to indifference. The situation had ceased to astonish
      him; already his keen mind had seen its possibilities, its grimness and
      its humour, and he was quite prepared to enjoy these to the full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy now was dusting the sleeve of his coat with a lace-edged
      handkerchief, but just as Chauvelin was about to come near him, he
      stretched out one leg, turning the point of a dainty boot towards the
      ex-ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would you like to take hold of me by the leg, Monsieur Chaubertin?” he
      said gaily. “'Tis more effectual than a shoulder, and your picked guard of
      six stalwart fellows can have the other leg.... Nay! I pray you, sir, do
      not look at me like that.... I vow that it is myself and not my ghost....
      But if you still doubt me, I pray you call the guard... ere I fly out
      again towards that fitful moon...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Sir Percy,” said Chauvelin, with a steady voice, “I have no thought
      that you will take flight just yet.... Methinks you desire conversation
      with me, or you had not paid me so unexpected a visit.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, sir, the air is too oppressive for lengthy conversation... I was
      strolling along these ramparts, thinking of our pleasant encounter at the
      hour of the Angelus to-morrow... when this light attracted me.... feared I
      had lost my way and climbed the window to obtain information.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “As to your way to the nearest prison cell, Sir Percy?” queried Chauvelin
      drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As to anywhere, where I could sit more comfortably than on this demmed
      sill.... It must be very dusty, and I vow 'tis terribly hard...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I presume, Sir Percy, that you did my colleague and myself the honour of
      listening to our conversation?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “An you desired to talk secrets, Monsieur... er... Chaubertin... you
      should have shut this window... and closed this avenue of trees against
      the chance passer-by.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What we said was no secret, Sir Percy. It is all over the town to-night.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Quite so... you were only telling the devil your mind... eh?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I had also been having conversation with Lady Blakeney.... Pray did you
      hear any of that, sir?”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Percy had evidently not heard the question, for he seemed quite
      absorbed in the task of removing a speck of dust from his immaculate
      chapeau-bras.
    </p>
    <p>
      “These hats are all the rage in England just now,” he said airily, “but
      they have had their day, do you not think so, Monsieur? When I return to
      town, I shall have to devote my whole mind to the invention of a new
      headgear...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “When will you return to England, Sir Percy?” queried Chauvelin with
      good-natured sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At the turn of the tide to-morrow eve, Monsieur,” replied Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In company with Lady Blakeney?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, sir... and yours if you will honour us with your company.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “If you return to England to-morrow, Sir Percy, Lady Blakeney, I fear me,
      cannot accompany you.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You astonish me, sir,” rejoined Blakeney with an exclamation of genuine
      and unaffected surprise. “I wonder now what would prevent her?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “All those whose death would be the result of her flight, if she succeeded
      in escaping from Boulogne...”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Percy was staring at him, with wide open eyes expressive of utmost
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear, dear, dear.... Lud! but that sounds most unfortunate...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You have not heard of the measures which I have taken to prevent Lady
      Blakeney quitting this city without our leave?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “No, Monsieur Chaubertin... no... I have heard nothing...” rejoined Sir
      Percy blandly. “I lead a very retired life when I come abroad and...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Would you wish to hear them now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Quite unnecessary, sir, I assure you... and the hour is getting late...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir Percy, are you aware of the fact that unless you listen to what I
      have to say, your wife will be dragged before the Committee of Public
      Safety in Paris within the next twenty-four hours?” said Chauvelin firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What swift horses you must have, sir,” quoth Blakeney pleasantly. “Lud!
      to think of it!... I always heard that these demmed French horses would
      never beat ours across country.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Chauvelin now would not allow himself to be ruffled by Sir Percy's
      apparent indifference. Keen reader of emotions as he was, he had not
      failed to note a distinct change in the drawly voice, a sound of something
      hard and trenchant in the flippant laugh, ever since Marguerite's name was
      first mentioned. Blakeney's attitude was apparently as careless, as
      audacious as before, but Chauvelin's keen eyes had not missed the almost
      imperceptible tightening of the jaw and the rapid clenching of one hand on
      the sword hilt even whilst the other toyed in graceful idleness with the
      filmy Mechlin lace cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy's head was well thrown back, and the pale rays of the moon
      caught the edge of the clear-cut profile, the low massive brow, the
      drooping lids through which the audacious plotter was lazily regarding the
      man who held not only his own life, but that of the woman who was
      infinitely dear to him, in the hollow of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am afraid, Sir Percy,” continued Chauvelin drily, “that you are under
      the impression that bolts and bars will yield to your usual good luck, now
      that so precious a life is at stake as that of Lady Blakeney.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am a greater believer in impressions, Monsieur Chauvelin.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I told her just now that if she quitted Boulogne ere the Scarlet
      Pimpernel is in our hands, we should summarily shoot one member of every
      family in the town—the bread-winner.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A pleasant conceit, Monsieur... and one that does infinite credit to your
      inventive faculties.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Lady Blakeney, therefore, we hold safely enough,” continued Chauvelin,
      who no longer heeded the mocking observations of his enemy; “as for the
      Scarlet Pimpernel...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You have but to ring a bell, to raise a voice, and he too will be under
      lock and key within the next two minutes, eh?... Passons, Monsieur... you
      are dying to say something further... I pray you proceed... your engaging
      countenance is becoming quite interesting in its seriousness.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What I wish to say to you, Sir Percy, is in the nature of a proposed
      bargain.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed?... Monsieur, you are full of surprises... like a pretty woman....
      And pray what are the terms of this proposed bargain?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Your side of the bargain, Sir Percy, or mine? Which will you hear first?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh yours, Monsieur... yours, I pray you.... Have I not said that you are
      like a pretty woman?... Place aux dames, sir! always!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “My share of the bargain, sir, is simple enough: Lady Blakeney, escorted
      by yourself and any of your friends who might be in this city at the time,
      shall leave Boulogne harbour at sunset to-morrow, free and unmolested, if
      you on the other hand will do your share...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I don't yet know what my share in this interesting bargain is to be,
      sir... but for the sake of argument let us suppose that I do not carry it
      out.... What then?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then, Sir Percy... putting aside for the moment the question of the
      Scarlet Pimpernel altogether... then, Lady Blakeney will be taken to
      Paris, and will be incarcerated in the prison of the Temple lately vacated
      by Marie Antoinette—there she will be treated in exactly the same
      way as the ex-queen is now being treated in the Conciergerie.... Do you
      know what that means, Sir Percy?... It does not mean a summary trial and a
      speedy death, with the halo and glory of martyrdom thrown in... it means
      days, weeks, nay, months, perhaps, of misery and humiliation... it means,
      that like Marie Antoinette, she will never be allowed solitude for one
      single instant of the day or night... it means the constant proximity of
      soldiers, drunk with cruelty and with hate... the insults, the shame...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You hound!... you dog!... you cur!... do you not see that I must strangle
      you for this!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      The attack had been so sudden and so violent that Chauvelin had not the
      time to utter the slightest call for help. But a second ago, Sir Percy
      Blakeney had been sitting on the window-sill, outwardly listening with
      perfect calm to what his enemy had to say; now he was at the latter's
      throat, pressing with long and slender hands the breath out of the
      Frenchman's body, his usually placid face distorted into a mask of hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You cur!... you cur!...” he repeated, “am I to kill you or will you unsay
      those words?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he relaxed his grip. The habits of a lifetime would not be
      gainsaid even now. A second ago his face had been livid with rage and
      hate, now a quick flush overspread it, as if he were ashamed of this loss
      of self-control. He threw the little Frenchman away from him like he would
      a beast which had snarled, and passed his hand across his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud forgive me!” he said quaintly, “I had almost lost my temper.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin was not slow in recovering himself. He was plucky and alert, and
      his hatred for this man was so great that he had actually ceased to fear
      him. Now he quietly readjusted his cravat, made a vigorous effort to
      re-conquer his breath, and said firmly as soon as he could contrive to
      speak at all:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if you did strangle me, Sir Percy, you would do yourself no good. The
      fate which I have mapped out for Lady Blakeney, would then irrevocably be
      hers, for she is in our power and none of my colleagues are disposed to
      offer you a means of saving her from it, as I am ready to do.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Blakeney was now standing in the middle of the room, with his hands buried
      in the pockets of his breeches, his manner and attitude once more calm,
      debonnair, expressive of lofty self-possession and of absolute
      indifference. He came quite close to the meagre little figure of his
      exultant enemy, thereby forcing the latter to look up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!... ah!... yes!” he said airily, “I had nigh forgotten... you were
      talking of a bargain... my share of it... eh?... Is it me you want?... Do
      you wish to see me in your Paris prisons?... I assure you, sir, that the
      propinquity of drunken soldiers may disgust me, but it would in no way
      disturb the equanimity of my temper.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am quite sure of that, Sir Percy—and I can but repeat what I had
      the honour of saying to Lady Blakeney just now—I do not desire the
      death of so accomplished a gentleman as yourself.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Strange, Monsieur,” retorted Blakeney, with a return of his accustomed
      flippancy. “Now I do desire your death very strongly indeed—there
      would be so much less vermin on the face of the earth.... But pardon me—I
      was interrupting you.... Will you be so kind as to proceed?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had not winced at the insult. His enemy's attitude now left him
      completely indifferent. He had seen that self-possessed man of the world,
      that dainty and fastidious dandy, in the throes of an overmastering
      passion. He had very nearly paid with his life for the joy of having
      roused that supercilious and dormant lion. In fact he was ready to welcome
      any insults from Sir Percy Blakeney now, since these would be only
      additional evidences that the Englishman's temper was not yet under
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will try to be brief, Sir Percy,” he said, setting himself the task of
      imitating his antagonist's affected manner. “Will you not sit down?... We
      must try and discuss these matters like two men of the world.... As for
      me, I am always happiest beside a board littered with papers.... I am not
      an athlete, Sir Percy... and serve my country with my pen rather than with
      my fists.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he spoke he had reached the table and once more took the chair
      whereon he had been sitting lately, when he dreamed the dreams which were
      so near realization now. He pointed with a graceful gesture to the other
      vacant chair, which Blakeney took without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah!” said Chauvelin with a sigh of satisfaction, “I see that we are about
      to understand one another.... I have always felt it was a pity, Sir Percy,
      that you and I could not discuss certain matters pleasantly with one
      another.... Now, about this unfortunate incident of Lady Blakeney's
      incarceration, I would like you to believe that I had no part in the
      arrangements which have been made for her detention in Paris. My
      colleagues have arranged it all... and I have vainly tried to protest
      against the rigorous measures which are to be enforced against her in the
      Temple prison.... But these are answering so completely in the case of the
      ex-queen, they have so completely broken her spirit and her pride, that my
      colleagues felt that they would prove equally useful in order to bring the
      Scarlet Pimpernel—through his wife—to an humbler frame of
      mind.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, distinctly pleased with his peroration, satisfied that
      his voice had been without a tremor and his face impassive, and wondering
      what effect this somewhat lengthy preamble had upon Sir Percy, who through
      it all had remained singularly quiet. Chauvelin was preparing himself for
      the next effect which he hoped to produce, and was vaguely seeking for the
      best words with which to fully express his meaning, when he was suddenly
      startled by a sound as unexpected as it was disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sound of a loud and prolonged snore. He pushed the candle
      aside, which somewhat obstructed his line of vision, and casting a rapid
      glance at the enemy, with whose life he was toying even as a cat doth with
      that of a mouse, he saw that the aforesaid mouse was calmly and
      unmistakably asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impatient oath escaped Chauvelin's lips, and he brought his fist
      heavily down on the table, making the metal candlesticks rattle and
      causing Sir Percy to open one sleepy eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand pardons, sir,” said Blakeney with a slight yawn. “I am so
      demmed fatigued, and your preface was unduly long.... Beastly bad form, I
      know, going to sleep during a sermon... but I haven't had a wink of sleep
      all day.... I pray you to excuse me...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Will you condescend to listen, Sir Percy?” queried Chauvelin
      peremptorily, “or shall I call the guard and give up all thoughts of
      treating with you?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Just whichever you demmed well prefer, sir,” rejoined Blakeney
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more stretching out his long limbs, he buried his hands in the
      pockets of his breeches and apparently prepared himself for another quiet
      sleep. Chauvelin looked at him for a moment, vaguely wondering what to do
      next. He felt strangely irritated at what he firmly believed was mere
      affectation on Blakeney's part, and although he was burning with
      impatience to place the terms of the proposed bargain before this man, yet
      he would have preferred to be interrogated, to deliver his “either-or”
       with becoming sternness and decision, rather than to take the initiative
      in this discussion, where he should have been calm and indifferent, whilst
      his enemy should have been nervous and disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy's attitude had disconcerted him, a touch of the grotesque had
      been given to what should have been a tense moment, and it was terribly
      galling to the pride of the ex-diplomatist that with this elusive enemy
      and in spite of his own preparedness for any eventuality, it was
      invariably the unforeseen that happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment's reflection, however, he decided upon a fresh course of
      action. He rose and crossed the room, keeping as much as possible an eye
      upon Sir Percy, but the latter sat placid and dormant and evidently in no
      hurry to move. Chauvelin having reached the door, opened it noiselessly,
      and to the sergeant in command of his bodyguard who stood at attention
      outside, he whispered hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The prisoner from No. 6.... Let two of the men bring her hither back to
      me at once.”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI: The Terms of the Bargain
    </h2>
    <p>
      Less than three minutes later, there came to Chauvelin's expectant ears
      the soft sound made by a woman's skirts against the stone floor. During
      those three minutes, which had seemed an eternity to his impatience, he
      had sat silently watching the slumber—affected or real—of his
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly he heard the word: “Halt!” outside the door, he jumped to his
      feet. The next moment Marguerite had entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had her foot crossed the threshold than Sir Percy rose, quietly and
      without haste but evidently fully awake, and turning towards her, made her
      a low obeisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, poor woman, had of course caught sight of him at once. His presence
      here, Chauvelin's demand for her reappearance, the soldiers in a small
      compact group outside the door, all these were unmistakable proofs that
      the awful cataclysm had at last occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scarlet Pimpernel, Percy Blakeney, her husband, was in the hands of
      the Terrorists of France, and though face to face with her now, with an
      open window close to him, and an apparently helpless enemy under his hand,
      he could not—owing to the fiendish measures taken by Chauvelin—raise
      a finger to save himself and her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercifully for her, nature—in the face of this appalling tragedy—deprived
      her of the full measure of her senses. She could move and speak and see,
      she could hear and in a measure understand what was said, but she was
      really an automaton or a sleep-walker, moving and speaking mechanically
      and without due comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly, if she had then and there fully realized all that the future
      meant, she would have gone mad with the horror of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lady Blakeney,” began Chauvelin after he had quickly dismissed the
      soldiers from the room, “when you and I parted from one another just now,
      I had no idea that I should so soon have the pleasure of a personal
      conversation with Sir Percy.... There is no occasion yet, believe me, for
      sorrow or fear.... Another twenty-four hours at most, and you will be on
      board the 'Day-Dream' outward bound for England. Sir Percy himself might
      perhaps accompany you; he does not desire that you should journey to
      Paris, and I may safely say, that in his mind, he has already accepted
      certain little conditions which I have been forced to impose upon him ere
      I sign the order for your absolute release.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Conditions?” she repeated vaguely and stupidly, looking in bewilderment
      from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are tired, m'dear,” said Sir Percy quietly, “will you not sit down?”
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the chair gallantly for her. She tried to read his face, but could
      not catch even a flash from beneath the heavy lids which obstinately
      veiled his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! it is a mere matter of exchanging signatures,” continued Chauvelin in
      response to her inquiring glance and toying with the papers which were
      scattered on the table. “Here you see is the order to allow Sir Percy
      Blakeney and his wife, nee Marguerite St. Just, to quit the town of
      Boulogne unmolested.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He held a paper out towards Marguerite, inviting her to look at it. She
      caught sight of an official-looking document, bearing the motto and seal
      of the Republic of France, and of her own name and Percy's written thereon
      in full.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is perfectly en regle, I assure you,” continued Chauvelin, “and only
      awaits my signature.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He now took up another paper which looked like a long closely-written
      letter. Marguerite watched his every movement, for instinct told her that
      the supreme moment had come. There was a look of almost superhuman cruelty
      and malice in the little Frenchman's eyes as he fixed them on the
      impassive figure of Sir Percy, the while with slightly trembling hands he
      fingered that piece of paper and smoothed out its creases with loving
      care.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am quite prepared to sign the order for your release, Lady Blakeney,”
       he said, keeping his gaze still keenly fixed upon Sir Percy. “When it is
      signed you will understand that our measures against the citizens of
      Boulogne will no longer hold good, and that on the contrary, the general
      amnesty and free pardon will come into force.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I understand that,” she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And all that will come to pass, Lady Blakeney, the moment Sir Percy will
      write me in his own hand a letter, in accordance with the draft which I
      have prepared, and sign it with his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shall I read it to you?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you please.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You will see how simple it all is.... A mere matter of form.... I pray
      you do not look upon it with terror, but only as the prelude to that
      general amnesty and free pardon, which I feel sure will satisfy the
      philanthropic heart of the noble Scarlet Pimpernel, since three score at
      least of the inhabitants of Boulogne will owe their life and freedom to
      him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I am listening, Monsieur,” she said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I have already had the honour of explaining, this little document is
      in the form of a letter addressed personally to me and of course in
      French,” he said finally, and then he looked down on the paper and began
      to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      Citizen Chauvelin—
    </p>
    <p>
      In consideration of a further sum of one million francs and on the
      understanding that this ridiculous charge brought against me of conspiring
      against the Republic of France is immediately withdrawn, and I am allowed
      to return to England unmolested, I am quite prepared to acquaint you with
      the names and whereabouts of certain persons who under the guise of the
      League of the Scarlet Pimpernel are even now conspiring to free the woman
      Marie Antoinette and her son from prison and to place the latter upon the
      throne of France. You are quite well aware that under the pretence of
      being the leader of a gang of English adventurers, who never did the
      Republic of France and her people any real harm, I have actually been the
      means of unmasking many a royalist plot before you, and of bringing many
      persistent conspirators to the guillotine. I am surprised that you should
      cavil at the price I am asking this time for the very important
      information with which I am able to furnish you, whilst you have often
      paid me similar sums for work which was a great deal less difficult to do.
      In order to serve your government effectually, both in England and in
      France, I must have a sufficiency of money, to enable me to live in a
      costly style befitting a gentleman of my rank. Were I to alter my mode of
      life I could not continue to mix in that same social milieu to which all
      my friends belong and wherein, as you are well aware, most of the royalist
      plots are hatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trusting therefore to receive a favourable reply to my just demands within
      the next twenty-four hours, whereupon the names in question shall be
      furnished you forthwith,
    </p>
    <p>
      I have the honour to remain, Citizen,
    </p>
    <p>
      Your humble and obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper up again,
      and then only did he look at the man and the woman before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite sat very erect, her head thrown back, her face very pale and
      her hands tightly clutched in her lap. She had not stirred whilst
      Chauvelin read out the infamous document, with which he desired to brand a
      brave man with the ineradicable stigma of dishonour and of shame. After
      she heard the first words, she looked up swiftly and questioningly at her
      husband, but he stood at some little distance from her, right out of the
      flickering circle of yellowish light made by the burning tallow-candle. He
      was as rigid as a statue, standing in his usual attitude with legs apart
      and hands buried in his breeches pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not see his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she may have felt with regard to the letter, as the meaning of it
      gradually penetrated into her brain, she was, of course, convinced of one
      thing, and that was that never for a moment would Percy dream of
      purchasing his life or even hers at such a price. But she would have liked
      some sign from him, some look by which she could be guided as to her
      immediate conduct: as, however, he gave neither look nor sign, she
      preferred to assume an attitude of silent contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even before Chauvelin had had time to look from one face to the other,
      a prolonged and merry laugh echoed across the squalid room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy, with head thrown back, was laughing whole-heartedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A magnificent epistle, sir,” he said gaily, “Lud love you, where did you
      wield the pen so gracefully?... I vow that if I signed this interesting
      document no one will believe I could have expressed myself with perfect
      ease.. and in French too...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Sir Percy,” rejoined Chauvelin drily, “I have thought of all that,
      and lest in the future there should be any doubt as to whether your own
      hand had or had not penned the whole of this letter, I also make it a
      condition that you write out every word of it yourself, and sign it here
      in this very room, in the presence of Lady Blakeney, of myself, of my
      colleagues and of at least half a dozen other persons whom I will select.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is indeed admirably thought out, Monsieur,” rejoined Sir Percy, “and
      what is to become of the charming epistle, may I ask, after I have written
      and signed it?... Pardon my curiosity.... I take a natural interest in the
      matter... and truly your ingenuity passes belief...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! the fate of this letter will be as simple as was the writing
      thereof.... A copy of it will be published in our 'Gazette de Paris' as a
      bait for enterprising English journalists.... They will not be backward in
      getting hold of so much interesting matter.... Can you not see the
      attractive headlines in 'The London Gazette,' Sir Percy? 'The League of
      the Scarlet Pimpernel unmasked! A gigantic hoax! The origin of the
      Blakeney millions!'... I believe that journalism in England has reached a
      high standard of excellence... and even the 'Gazette de Paris' is greatly
      read in certain towns of your charming country.... His Royal Highness the
      Prince of Wales, and various other influential gentlemen in London, will,
      on the other hand, be granted a private view of the original through the
      kind offices of certain devoted friends whom we possess in England.... I
      don't think that you need have any fear, Sir Percy, that your caligraphy
      will sink into oblivion. It will be our business to see that it obtains
      the full measure of publicity which it deserves...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, then his manner suddenly changed: the sarcastic tone
      died out of his voice, and there came back into his face that look of
      hatred and cruelty which Blakeney's persiflage had always the power to
      evoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may rest assured of one thing, Sir Percy,” he said with a harsh
      laugh, “that enough mud will be thrown at that erstwhile glorious Scarlet
      Pimpernel... some of it will be bound to stick...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Monsieur... er... Chaubertin,” quoth Blakeney lightly, “I have no
      doubt that you and your colleagues are past masters in the graceful art of
      mud-throwing.... But pardon me... er.... I was interrupting you....
      Continue, Monsieur... continue, I pray. 'Pon my honour, the matter is
      vastly diverting.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, sir, after the publication of this diverting epistle, meseems your
      honour will ceased to be a marketable commodity.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Undoubtedly, sir,” rejoined Sir Percy, apparently quite unruffled,
      “pardon a slip of the tongue... we are so much the creatures of habit....
      As you were saying...?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I have but little more to say, sir.... But lest there should even now be
      lurking in your mind a vague hope that, having written this letter, you
      could easily in the future deny its authorship, let me tell you this: my
      measures are well taken, there will be witnesses to your writing of it....
      You will sit here in this room, unfettered, uncoerced in any way, and the
      money spoken of in the letter will be handed over to you by my colleague,
      after a few suitable words spoken by him, and you will take the money from
      him, Sir Percy... and the witnesses will see you take it after having seen
      you write the letter... they will understand that you are being PAID by
      the French government for giving information anent royalist plots in this
      country and in England... they will understand that your identity as the
      leader of that so-called band is not only known to me and to my colleague,
      but that it also covers your real character and profession as the paid spy
      of France.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Marvellous, I call it... demmed marvellous,” quoth Sir Percy blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had paused, half-choked by his own emotion, his hatred and
      prospective revenge. He passed his handkerchief over his forehead, which
      was streaming with perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Warm work, this sort of thing... eh... Monsieur... er... Chaubertin?...”
       queried his imperturbable enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite said nothing; the whole thing was too horrible for words, but
      she kept her large eyes fixed upon her husband's face... waiting for that
      look, that sign from him which would have eased the agonizing anxiety in
      her heart, and which never came.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a great effort now, Chauvelin pulled himself together and, though his
      voice still trembled, he managed to speak with a certain amount of calm:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Probably, Sir Percy, you know,” he said, “that throughout the whole of
      France we are inaugurating a series of national fetes, in honour of the
      new religion which the people are about to adopt.... Demoiselle Desiree
      Candeille, whom you know, will at these festivals impersonate the Goddess
      of Reason, the only deity whom we admit now in France.... She has been
      specially chosen for this honour, owing to the services which she has
      rendered us recently... and as Boulogne happens to be the lucky city in
      which we have succeeded in bringing the Scarlet Pimpernel to justice, the
      national fete will begin within these city walls, with Demoiselle
      Candeille as the thrice-honoured goddess.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And you will be very merry here in Boulogne, I dare swear...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye, merry, sir,” said Chauvelin with an involuntary and savage snarl, as
      he placed a long claw-like finger upon the momentous paper before him,
      “merry, for we here in Boulogne will see that which will fill the heart of
      every patriot in France with gladness.... Nay! 'twas not the death of the
      Scarlet Pimpernel we wanted... not the noble martyrdom of England's chosen
      hero... but his humiliation and defeat... derision and scorn... contumely
      and contempt. You asked me airily just now, Sir Percy, how I proposed to
      accomplish this object... Well! you know it now—by forcing you...
      aye, forcing—to write and sign a letter and to take money from my
      hands which will brand you forever as a liar and informer, and cover you
      with the thick and slimy mud of irreclaimable infamy...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Lud! sir,” said Sir Percy pleasantly, “what a wonderful command you have
      of our language.... I wish I could speak French half as well...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite had risen like an automaton from her chair. She felt that she
      could no longer sit still, she wanted to scream out at the top of her
      voice, all the horror she felt for this dastardly plot, which surely must
      have had its origin in the brain of devils. She could not understand
      Percy. This was one of those awful moments, which she had been destined to
      experience once or twice before, when the whole personality of her husband
      seemed to become shadowy before her, to slip, as it were, past her
      comprehension, leaving her indescribably lonely and wretched, trusting yet
      terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that long ere this he would have flung back every insult in
      his opponent's teeth; she did not know what inducements Chauvelin had held
      out in exchange for the infamous letter, what threats he had used. That
      her own life and freedom were at stake, was, of course, evident, but she
      cared nothing for life, and he should know that certainly she would care
      still less if such a price had to be paid for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She longed to tell him all that was in her heart, longed to tell him how
      little she valued her life, how highly she prized his honour! but how
      could she, before this fiend who snarled and sneered in his anticipated
      triumph, and surely, surely Percy knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      And knowing all that, why did he not speak? Why did he not tear that
      infamous paper from out that devil's hands and fling it in his face? Yet,
      though her loving ear caught every intonation of her husband's voice, she
      could not detect the slightest harshness in his airy laugh; his tone was
      perfectly natural and he seemed to be, indeed, just as he appeared—vastly
      amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she thought that perhaps he would wish her to go now, that he felt
      desire to be alone with this man, who had outraged him in everything that
      he held most holy and most dear, his honour and his wife... that perhaps,
      knowing that his own temper was no longer under control, he did not wish
      her to witness the rough and ready chastisement which he was intending to
      mete out to this dastardly intriguer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! that was it no doubt! Herein she could not be mistaken; she knew his
      fastidious notions of what was due and proper in the presence of a woman,
      and that even at a moment like this, he would wish the manners of London
      drawing-rooms to govern his every action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore she rose to go, and as she did so, once more tried to read the
      expression in his face... to guess what was passing in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Madam,” he said, whilst he bowed gracefully before her, “I fear me
      this lengthy conversation hath somewhat fatigued you.... This merry jest
      'twixt my engaging friend and myself should not have been prolonged so far
      into the night.... Monsieur, I pray you, will you not give orders that her
      ladyship be escorted back to her room?”
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still standing outside the circle of light, and Marguerite
      instinctively went up to him. For this one second she was oblivious of
      Chauvelin's presence, she forgot her well-schooled pride, her firm
      determination to be silent and to be brave: she could no longer restrain
      the wild beatings of her heart, the agony of her soul, and with sudden
      impulse she murmured in a voice broken with intense love and subdued,
      passionate appeal:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy!”
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew back a step further into the gloom: this made her realize the
      mistake she had made in allowing her husband's most bitter enemy to get
      this brief glimpse into her soul. Chauvelin's thin lips curled with
      satisfaction, the brief glimpse had been sufficient for him, the rapidly
      whispered name, the broken accent had told him what he had not known
      hitherto: namely, that between this man and woman there was a bond far
      more powerful that that which usually existed between husband and wife,
      and merely made up of chivalry on the one side and trustful reliance on
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite having realized her mistake, ashamed of having betrayed her
      feelings even for a moment, threw back her proud head and gave her
      exultant foe a look of defiance and of scorn. He responded with one of
      pity, not altogether unmixed with deference. There was something almost
      unearthly and sublime in this beautiful woman's agonizing despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his head and made her a deep obeisance, lest she should see the
      satisfaction and triumph which shone through his pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual Sir Percy remained quite imperturbable, and now it was he, who,
      with characteristic impudence, touched the hand-bell on the table:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Excuse this intrusion, Monsieur,” he said lightly, “her ladyship is
      overfatigued and would be best in her room.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite threw him a grateful look. After all she was only a woman and
      was afraid of breaking down. In her mind there was no issue to the present
      deadlock save in death. For this she was prepared and had but one great
      hope that she could lie in her husband's arms just once again before she
      died. Now, since she could not speak to him, scarcely dared to look into
      the loved face, she was quite ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the bell, the soldier had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If Lady Blakeney desires to go...” said Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and Chauvelin gave the necessary orders: two soldiers stood at
      attention ready to escort Marguerite back to her prison cell. As she went
      towards the door she came to within a couple of steps from where her
      husband was standing, bowing to her as she passed. She stretched out an
      icy cold hand towards him, and he, in the most approved London fashion,
      with the courtly grace of a perfect English gentleman, took the little
      hand in his and stooping very low kissed the delicate finger-tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then only did she notice that the strong, nervy hand which held hers
      trembled perceptibly, and that his lips—which for an instant rested
      on her fingers—were burning hot.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXVII: The Decision
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once more the two men were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as Chauvelin was concerned he felt that everything was not yet
      settled, and until a moment ago he had been in doubt as to whether Sir
      Percy would accept the infamous conditions which had been put before him,
      or allow his pride and temper to get the better of him and throw the
      deadly insults back into his adversary's teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now a new secret had been revealed to the astute diplomatist. A name,
      softly murmured by a broken-hearted woman, had told him a tale of love and
      passion, which he had not even suspected before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he had made this discovery he knew that the ultimate issue was no
      longer in doubt. Sir Percy Blakeney, the bold adventurer, ever ready for a
      gamble where lives were at stake, might have demurred before he subscribed
      to his own dishonour, in order to save his wife from humiliation and the
      shame of the terrible fate that had been mapped out for her. But the same
      man passionately in love with such a woman as Marguerite Blakeney would
      count the world well lost for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      One sudden fear alone had shot through Chauvelin's heart when he stood
      face to face with the two people whom he had so deeply and cruelly
      wronged, and that was that Blakeney, throwing aside all thought of the
      scores of innocent lives that were at stake, might forget everything, risk
      everything, dare everything, in order to get his wife away there and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the space of a few seconds Chauvelin had felt that his own life was in
      jeopardy, and that the Scarlet Pimpernel would indeed make a desperate
      effort to save himself and his wife. But the fear was short-lived:
      Marguerite—as he had well foreseen—would never save herself at
      the expense of others, and she was tied! tied! tied! That was his triumph
      and his joy!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marguerite finally left the room, Sir Percy made no motion to follow
      her, but turned once more quietly to his antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you were saying, Monsieur?...” he queried lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! there is nothing more to say, Sir Percy,” rejoined Chauvelin; “my
      conditions are clear to you, are they not? Lady Blakeney's and your own
      immediate release in exchange for a letter written to me by your own hand,
      and signed here by you—in this room—in my presence and that of
      sundry other persons whom I need not name just now. Also certain money
      passing from my hand to yours. Failing the letter, a long, hideously
      humiliating sojourn in the Temple prison for your wife, a prolonged trial
      and the guillotine as a happy release!... I would add, the same thing for
      yourself, only that I will do you the justice to admit that you probably
      do not care.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! a grave mistake, Monsieur.... I do care... vastly care, I assure you
      ... and would seriously object to ending my life on your demmed
      guillotine... a nasty, uncomfortable thing, I should say... and I am told
      that an inexperienced barber is deputed to cut one's hair.... Brrr!...
      Now, on the other hand, I like the idea of a national fete... that pretty
      wench Candeille, dressed as a goddess... the boom of the cannon when your
      amnesty comes into force.... You WILL boom the cannon, will you not,
      Monsieur?... Cannon are demmed noisy, but they are effective sometimes, do
      you not think so, Monsieur?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Very effective certainly, Sir Percy,” sneered Chauvelin, “and we will
      certainly boom the cannon from this very fort, an it so please you....”
     </p>
    <p>
      “At what hour, Monsieur, is my letter to be ready?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why! at any hour you please, Sir Percy.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “The 'Day-Dream' could weigh anchor at eight o'clock... would an hour
      before that be convenient to yourself?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Certainly, Sir Percy... if you will honour me by accepting my hospitality
      in these uncomfortable quarters until seven o'clock to-morrow eve?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, Monsieur...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Then am I to understand, Sir Percy, that...”
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud and ringing laugh broke from Blakeney's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That I accept your bargain, man!... Zounds! I tell you I accept... I'll
      write the letter, I'll sign it... an you have our free passes ready for us
      in exchange.... At seven o'clock to-morrow eve, did you say?... Man! do
      not look so astonished.... The letter, the signature, the money... all
      your witnesses... have everything ready.... I accept, I say.... And now,
      in the name of all the evil spirits in hell, let me have some supper and a
      bed, for I vow that I am demmed fatigued.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And without more ado Sir Percy once more rang the handbell, laughing
      boisterously the while: then suddenly, with quick transition of mood, his
      laugh was lost in a gigantic yawn, and throwing his long body onto a
      chair, he stretched out his legs, buried his hands in his pockets, and the
      next moment was peacefully asleep.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII: The Midnight Watch
    </h2>
    <p>
      Boulogne had gone through many phases, in its own languid and sleepy way,
      whilst the great upheaval of a gigantic revolution shook other cities of
      France to their very foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the little town had held somnolently aloof, and whilst Lyons and
      Tours conspired and rebelled, whilst Marseilles and Toulon opened their
      ports to the English and Dunkirk was ready to surrender to the allied
      forces, she had gazed through half-closed eyes at all the turmoil, and
      then quietly turned over and gone to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boulogne fished and mended nets, built boats and manufactured boots with
      placid content, whilst France murdered her king and butchered her
      citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The initial noise of the great revolution was only wafted on the southerly
      breezes from Paris to the little seaport towns of Northern France, and
      lost much of its volume and power in this aerial transit: the fisher folk
      were too poor to worry about the dethronement of kings: the struggle for
      daily existence, the perils and hardships of deep-sea fishing engrossed
      all the faculties they possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the burghers and merchants of the town, they were at first content
      with reading an occasional article in the “Gazette de Paris” or the
      “Gazette des Tribunaux,” brought hither by one or other of the many
      travellers who crossed the city on their way to the harbour. They were
      interested in these articles, at times even comfortably horrified at the
      doings in Paris, the executions and the tumbrils, but on the whole they
      liked the idea that the country was in future to be governed by duly
      chosen representatives of the people, rather than be a prey to the
      despotism of kings, and they were really quite pleased to see the
      tricolour flag hoisted on the old Beffroi, there where the snow-white
      standard of the Bourbons had erstwhile flaunted its golden fleur-de-lis in
      the glare of the midday sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy burgesses of Boulogne were ready to shout: “Vive la
      Republique!” with the same cheerful and raucous Normandy accent as they
      had lately shouted “Dieu protege le Roi!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The first awakening from this happy torpor came when that tent was put up
      on the landing stage in the harbour. Officials, dressed in shabby uniforms
      and wearing tricolour cockades and scarves, were now quartered in the Town
      Hall, and repaired daily to that roughly erected tent, accompanied by so
      many soldiers from the garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      There installed, they busied themselves with examining carefully the
      passports of all those who desired to leave or enter Boulogne. Fisher-folk
      who had dwelt in the city—father and son and grandfather and many
      generations before that—and had come and gone in and out of their
      own boats as they pleased, were now stopped as they beached their craft
      and made to give an account of themselves to these officials from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of a truth, more than ridiculous, that these strangers should ask
      of Jean-Marie who he was, or of Pierre what was his business, or of Desire
      Francois whither he was going, when Jean-Marie and Pierre and Desire
      Francois had plied their nets in the roads outside Boulogne harbour for
      more years than they would care to count.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also caused no small measure of annoyance that fishermen were ordered
      to wear tricolour cockades on their caps. They had no special ill-feeling
      against tricolour cockades, but they did not care about them. Jean-Marie
      flatly refused to have one pinned on, and being admonished somewhat
      severely by one of the Paris officials, he became obstinate about the
      whole thing and threw the cockade violently on the ground and spat upon
      it, not from any sentiment of anti-republicanism, but just from a feeling
      of Norman doggedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was arrested, shut up in Fort Gayole, tried as a traitor and publicly
      guillotined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consternation in Boulogne was appalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one little spark had found its way to a barrel of blasting powder and
      caused a terrible explosion. Within twenty-four hours of Jean-Marie's
      execution the whole town was in the throes of the Revolution. What the
      death of King Louis, the arrest of Marie Antoinette, the massacres of
      September had failed to do, that the arrest and execution of an elderly
      fisherman accomplished in a trice.
    </p>
    <p>
      People began to take sides in politics. Some families realized that they
      came from ancient lineage, and that their ancestors had helped to build up
      the throne of the Bourbons. Others looked up ancient archives and
      remembered past oppressions at the hands of the aristocrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus some burghers of Boulogne became ardent reactionaries, whilst others
      secretly nursed enthusiastic royalist convictions: some were ready to
      throw in their lot with the anarchists, to deny the religion of their
      fathers, to scorn the priests and close the places of worship; others
      adhered strictly still to the usages and practices of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrest became frequent: the guillotine, erected in the Place de la
      Senechaussee, had plenty of work to do. Soon the cathedral was closed, the
      priests thrown into prison, whilst scores of families hoped to escape a
      similar fate by summary flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vague rumours of a band of English adventurers soon reached the little
      sea-port town. The Scarlet Pimpernel—English spy or hero, as he was
      alternately called—had helped many a family with pronounced royalist
      tendencies to escape the fury of the blood-thirsty Terrorists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus gradually the anti-revolutionaries had been weeded out of the city:
      some by death and imprisonment, others by flight. Boulogne became the
      hotbed of anarchism: the idlers and loafers, inseparable from any town
      where there is a garrison and a harbour, practically ruled the city now.
      Denunciations were the order of the day. Everyone who owned any money, or
      lived with any comfort was accused of being a traitor and suspected of
      conspiracy. The fisher folk wandered about the city, surly and
      discontented: their trade was at a standstill, but there was a trifle to
      be earned by giving information: information which meant the arrest,
      ofttimes the death of men, women and even children who had tried to seek
      safety in flight, and to denounce whom—as they were trying to hire a
      boat anywhere along the coast—meant a good square meal for a
      starving family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the awful cataclysm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman—a stranger—had been arrested and imprisoned in the
      Fort Gayole and the town-crier publicly proclaimed that if she escaped
      from jail, one member of every family in the town—rich or poor,
      republican or royalist, Catholic or free-thinker—would be summarily
      guillotined.
    </p>
    <p>
      That member, the bread-winner!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, then, with the Duvals it would be young Francois-Auguste. He keeps
      his old mother with his boot-making...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And it would be Marie Lebon, she has her blind father dependent on her
      net-mending.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And old Mother Laferriere, whose grandchildren were left penniless... she
      keeps them from starvation by her wash-tub.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But Francois-Auguste is a real Republican; he belongs to the Jacobin
      Club.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And look at Pierre, who never meets a calotin but he must needs spit on
      him.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Is there no safety anywhere?... are we to be butchered like so many
      cattle?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody makes the suggestion:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is a threat... they would not dare!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Would not dare?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      'Tis old Andre Lemoine who has spoken, and he spits vigorously on the
      ground. Andre Lemoine has been a soldier; he was in La Vendee. He was
      wounded at Tours... and he knows!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would not dare?...” he says in a whisper. “I tell you, friends, that
      there's nothing the present government would not dare. There was the
      Plaine Saint Mauve... Did you ever hear about that?... little children
      fusilladed by the score... little ones, I say, and women with babies at
      their breasts ... weren't they innocent?... Five hundred innocent people
      butchered in La Vendee... until the Headsman sank—worn not... I
      could tell worse than that... for I know.... There's nothing they would
      not dare!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Consternation was so great that the matter could not even be discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We'll go to Gayole and see this woman at any rate.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Angry, sullen crowds assembled in the streets. The proclamation had been
      read just as the men were leaving the public houses, preparing to go home
      for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought the news to the women, who, at home, were setting the soup
      and bread on the table for their husbands' supper. There was no thought of
      going to bed or of sleeping that night. The bread-winner in every family
      and all those dependent on him for daily sustenance were trembling for
      their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resistance to the barbarous order would have been worse than useless, nor
      did the thought of it enter the heads of these humble and ignorant fisher
      folk, wearied out with the miserable struggle for existence. There was not
      sufficient spirit left in this half-starved population of a small
      provincial city to suggest open rebellion. A regiment of soldiers come up
      from the South were quartered in the Chateau, and the natives of Boulogne
      could not have mustered more than a score of disused blunderbusses between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they remembered tales which Andre Lemoine had told, the fate of
      Lyons, razed to the ground, of Toulon burnt to ashes, and they did not
      dare rebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But brothers, fathers, sons trooped out towards Gayole, in order to have a
      good look at the frowning pile, which held the hostage for their safety.
      It looked dark and gloomy enough, save for one window which gave on the
      southern ramparts. This window was wide open and a feeble light flickered
      from the room beyond, and as the men stood about, gazing at the walls in
      sulky silence, they suddenly caught the sound of a loud laugh proceeding
      from within, and of a pleasant voice speaking quite gaily in a language
      which they did not understand, but which sounded like English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the heavy oaken gateway, leading to the courtyard of the prison,
      the proclamation written on stout parchment had been pinned up. Beside it
      hung a tiny lantern, the dim light of which flickered in the evening
      breeze, and brought at times into sudden relief the bold writing and heavy
      signature, which stood out, stern and grim, against the yellowish
      background of the paper, like black signs of approaching death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing the gateway and the proclamation, the crowd of men took its stand.
      The moon, from behind them, cast fitful, silvery glances at the weary
      heads bent in anxiety and watchful expectancy: on old heads and young
      heads, dark, curly heads and heads grizzled with age, on backs bent with
      toil, and hands rough and gnarled like seasoned timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night the men stood and watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentinels from the town guard were stationed at the gates, but these might
      prove inattentive or insufficient, they had not the same price at stake,
      so the entire able-bodied population of Boulogne watched the gloomy prison
      that night, lest anyone escaped by wall or window.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were guarding the precious hostage whose safety was the stipulation
      for their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was dead silence among them, and dead silence all around, save for
      that monotonous tok-tok-tok of the parchment flapping in the breeze. The
      moon, who all along had been capricious and chary of her light, made a
      final retreat behind a gathering bank of clouds, and the crowd, the
      soldiers and the great grim walls were all equally wrapped in gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the little lantern on the gateway now made a ruddy patch of light,
      and tinged that fluttering parchment with the colour of blood. Every now
      and then an isolated figure would detach itself from out the watching
      throng, and go up to the heavy, oaken door, in order to gaze at the
      proclamation. Then the light of the lantern illumined a dark head or a
      grey one, for a moment or two: black or white locks were stirred gently in
      the wind, and a sigh of puzzlement and disappointment would be distinctly
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times a group of three or four would stand there for awhile, not
      speaking, only sighing and casting eager questioning glances at one
      another, whilst trying vainly to find some hopeful word, some turn of
      phrase of meaning that would be less direful, in that grim and ferocious
      proclamation. Then a rough word from the sentinel, a push from the
      butt-end of a bayonet would disperse the little group and send the men,
      sullen and silent, back into the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they watched for hours whilst the bell of the Beffroi tolled all the
      hours of that tedious night. A thin rain began to fall in the small hours
      of the morning, a wetting, soaking drizzle which chilled the weary
      watchers to the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must not sleep, for the woman might escape.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of them squatted down in the muddy road, the luckier ones managed to
      lean their backs against the slimy walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice before the hour of midnight they heard that same quaint and merry
      laugh proceeding from the lighted room, through the open window. Once it
      sounded very low and very prolonged, as if in response to a delightful
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon the heavy gateway of Gayole was opened from within, and half a dozen
      soldiers came walking out of the courtyard. They were dressed in the
      uniform of the town-guard, but had evidently been picked out of the rank
      and file, for all six were exceptionally tall and stalwart, and towered
      above the sentinel, who saluted and presented arms as they marched out of
      the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of them walked a slight, dark figure, clad entirely in black,
      save for the tricolour scarf round his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of watchers gazed on the little party with suddenly awakened
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Who is it?” whispered some of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The citizen-governor,” suggested one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The new public executioner,” ventured another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No! no!” quoth Pierre Maxime, the doyen of Boulogne fishermen, and a
      great authority on every matter public or private with the town; “no, no
      he is the man who has come down from Paris, the friend of Robespierre. He
      makes the laws now, the citizen-governor even must obey him. 'Tis he who
      made the law that if the woman up yonder should escape...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Hush!... sh!... sh!...” came in frightened accents from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush, Pierre Maxine!... the Citizen might hear thee,” whispered the man
      who stood closest to the old fisherman; “the Citizen might hear thee, and
      think that we rebelled....”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What are these people doing here?' queried Chauvelin as he passed out
      into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They are watching the prison, Citizen,” replied the sentinel, whom he had
      thus addressed, “lest the female prisoner should attempt to escape.”
     </p>
    <p>
      With a satisfied smile, Chauvelin turned toward the Town Hall, closely
      surrounded by his escort. The crowd watched him and the soldiers as they
      quickly disappeared in the gloom, then they resumed the stolid, wearisome
      vigil of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Beffroi now tolled the midnight hour, the one solitary light in
      the old Fort was extinguished, and after that the frowning pile remained
      dark and still.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXIX: The National Fete
    </h2>
    <p>
      “Citizens of Boulogne, awake!”
     </p>
    <p>
      They had not slept, only some of them had fallen into drowsy somnolence,
      heavy and nerve-racking, worse indeed than any wakefulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the houses, the women too had kept the tedious vigil, listening for
      every sound, dreading every bit of news, which the wind might waft in
      through the small, open windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one prisoner escaped, every family in Boulogne would be deprived of the
      bread-winner. Therefore the women wept, and tried to remember those Paters
      and Aves which the tyranny of liberty, fraternity and equality had ordered
      them to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broken rosaries were fetched out from neglected corners, and knees stiff
      with endless, thankless toil were bent once more in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh God! Good God! Do not allow that woman to flee!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Holy Virgin! Mother of God! Make that she should not escape!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the women went out in the early dawn to take hot soup and coffee
      to their men who were watching outside the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has anything been seen?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Have ye seen the woman?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Which room is she in?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Why won't they let us see her?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Are you sure she hath not already escaped?”
     </p>
    <p>
      Questions and surmises went round in muffled whispers as the steaming cans
      were passed round. No one had a definite answer to give, although Desire
      Melun declared that he had, once during the night, caught sight of a
      woman's face at one of the windows above: but as he could not describe the
      woman's face, nor locate with any degree of precision the particular
      window at which she was supposed to have appeared, it was unanimously
      decided that Desire must have been dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Citizens of Boulogne, awake!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The cry came first from the Town Hall, and therefore from behind the crowd
      of men and women, whose faces had been so resolutely set for all these
      past hours towards the Gayole prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all awake! but too tired and cramped to move as yet, and to turn
      in the direction whence arose that cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Citizens of Boulogne, awake!”
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just the voice of Auguste Moleux, the town-crier of Boulogne, who,
      bell in hand, was trudging his way along the Rue Daumont, closely followed
      by two fellows of the municipal guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auguste was in the very midst of the sullen crowd, before the men even
      troubled about his presence here, but now with many a vigorous “Allons
      donc!” and “Voyez-moi ca, fais donc place, voyons!” he elbowed his way
      through the throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was neither tired nor cramped; he served the Republic in comfort and
      ease, and had slept soundly on his paillasse in the little garret allotted
      to him in the Town Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd parted in silence, to allow him to pass. Auguste was lean and
      powerful, the scanty and meagre food, doled out to him by a paternal
      government, had increased his muscular strength whilst reducing his fat.
      He had very hard elbows, and soon he managed, by dint of pushing and
      cursing to reach the gateway of Gayole.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Voyons! enlevez-moi ca,” he commanded in stentorian tones, pointing to
      the proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellows of the municipal guard fell to and tore the parchment away
      from the door whilst the crowd looked on with stupid amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did it all mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Auguste Moleux turned and faced the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mes enfants,” he said, “my little cabbages! wake up! the government of
      the Republic has decreed that to-day is to be a day of gaiety and public
      rejoicings!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Gaiety?... Public rejoicings forsooth, when the bread-winner of every
      family...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Hush! Hush! Be silent, all of you,” quoth Auguste impatiently, “you do
      not understand!... All that is at an end... There is no fear that the
      woman shall escape.... You are all to dance and rejoice.... The Scarlet
      Pimpernel has been captured in Boulogne, last night...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Qui ca the Scarlet Pimpernel?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Mais! 'tis that mysterious English adventurer who rescued people from the
      guillotine!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A hero? quoi?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “No! no! only an English spy, a friend of aristocrats... he would have
      cared nothing for the bread-winners of Boulogne...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “He would not have raised a finger to save them.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Who knows?” sighed a feminine voice, “perhaps he came to Boulogne to help
      them.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And he has been caught anyway,” concluded Auguste Moleux sententiously,
      “and, my little cabbages, remember this, that so great is the pleasure of
      the all-powerful Committee of Public Safety at this capture, that because
      he has been caught in Boulogne, therefore Boulogne is to be specially
      rewarded!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Holy Virgin, who'd have thought it?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sh... Jeanette, dost not know that there's no Holy Virgin now?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And dost know, Auguste, how we are to be rewarded?”
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a difficult matter for the human mind to turn very quickly from
      despair to hope, and the fishermen of Boulogne had not yet grasped the
      fact that they were to make merry and that thoughts of anxiety must be
      abandoned for those of gaiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auguste Moleux took out a parchment from the capacious pocket of his coat;
      he put on his most solemn air of officialdom, and pointing with extended
      forefinger to the parchment, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “A general amnesty to all natives of Boulogne who are under arrest at the
      present moment: a free pardon to all natives of Boulogne who are under
      sentence of death: permission to all natives of Boulogne to quit the town
      with their families, to embark on any vessel they please, in or out of the
      harbour, and to go whithersoever they choose, without passports,
      formalities or questions of any kind.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Dead silence followed this announcement. Hope was just beginning to crowd
      anxiety and sullenness out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then poor Andre Legrand will be pardoned,” whispered a voice suddenly;
      “he was to have been guillotined to-day.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And Denise Latour! she was innocent enough, the gentle pigeon.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And they'll let poor Abbe Foucquet out of prison too.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And Francois!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And poor Felicite, who is blind!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “M. l'Abbe would be wise to leave Boulogne with the children.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “He will too: thou canst be sure of that!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is not good to be a priest just now!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Bah! calotins are best dead than alive.”
     </p>
    <p>
      But some in the crowd were silent, others whispered eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Thinkest thou it would be safer for us to get out of the country whilst
      we can?” said one of the men in a muffled tone, and clutching nervously at
      a woman's wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! aye! it might leak out about that boat we procured for...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sh!... I was thinking of that...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “We can go to my aunt Lebrun in Belgium...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Others talked in whispers of England or the New Land across the seas: they
      were those who had something to hide, money received from refugee
      aristocrats, boats sold to would-be emigres, information withheld,
      denunciations shirked: the amnesty would not last long, 'twas best to be
      safely out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In the meanwhile, my cabbages,” quoth Auguste sententiously, “are you not
      grateful to Citizen Robespierre, who has sent this order specially down
      from Paris?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! aye!” assented the crowd cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah for Citizen Robespierre!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Viva la Republique!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And you will enjoy yourselves to-day?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “That we will!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Processions?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! with music and dancing.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Out there, far away, beyond the harbour, the grey light of dawn was
      yielding to the crimson glow of morning. The rain had ceased and heavy
      slaty clouds parted here and there, displaying glints of delicate
      turquoise sky, and tiny ethereal vapours in the dim and remote distance of
      infinity, flecked with touches of rose and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The towers and pinnacles of old Boulogne detached themselves one by one
      from the misty gloom of night. The old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour
      of six. Soon the massive cupola of Notre Dame was clothed in purple hues,
      and the gilt cross on St. Joseph threw back across the square a blinding
      ray of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town sparrows began to twitter, and from far out at sea in the
      direction of Dunkirk there came the muffled boom of cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And remember, my pigeons,” admonished Auguste Moleux solemnly, “that in
      this order which Robespierre has sent from Paris, it also says that from
      to-day onwards le bon Dieu has ceased to be!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Many faces were turned towards the East just then, for the rising sun,
      tearing with one gigantic sweep the banks of cloud asunder, now displayed
      his magnificence in a gorgeous immensity of flaming crimson. The sea, in
      response, turned to liquid fire beneath the glow, whilst the whole sky was
      irradiated with the first blush of morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Le bon Dieu has ceased to be!
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is only one religion in France now,” explained Auguste Moleux, “the
      religion of Reason! We are all citizens! We are all free and all able to
      think for ourselves. Citizen Robespierre has decreed that there is no good
      God. Le bon Dieu was a tyrant and an aristocrat, and, like all tyrants and
      aristocrats, He has been deposed. There is no good God, there is no Holy
      Virgin and no Saints, only Reason, who is a goddess and whom we all
      honour.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And the townsfolk of Boulogne, with eyes still fixed on the gorgeous East,
      shouted with sullen obedience:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah! for the Goddess of Reason!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah for Robespierre!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Only the women, trying to escape the town-crier's prying eyes, or the
      soldiers' stern gaze, hastily crossed themselves behind their husbands'
      backs, terrified lest le bon Dieu had, after all, not altogether ceased to
      exist at the bidding of Citizen Robespierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the worthy natives of Boulogne, forgetting their anxieties and fears,
      were ready enough to enjoy the national fete ordained for them by the
      Committee of Public Safety, in honour of the capture of the Scarlet
      Pimpernel. They were even willing to accept this new religion which
      Robespierre had invented: a religion which was only a mockery, with an
      actress to represent its supreme deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mais, que voulez-vous? Boulogne had long ago ceased to have faith in God:
      the terrors of the Revolution, which culminated in that agonizing watch of
      last night, had smothered all thoughts of worship and of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scarlet Pimpernel must indeed be a dangerous spy that his arrest
      should cause so much joy in Paris!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Boulogne had learned by experience that the Committee of Public
      Safety did not readily give up a prey, once its vulture-like claws had
      closed upon it. The proportion of condemnations as against acquittals was
      as a hundred to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But because this one man was taken, scores to-day were to be set free!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening at a given hour—seven o'clock as Auguste Moleux, the
      town-crier, understood—the boom of the cannon would be heard, the
      gates of the town would be opened, the harbour would become a free port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitants of Boulogne were ready to shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Vive the Scarlet Pimpernel!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever he was—hero or spy—he was undoubtedly the primary
      cause of all their joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Auguste Moleux had cried out the news throughout the town, and
      pinned the new proclamation of mercy up on every public building, all
      traces of fatigue and anxiety had vanished. In spite of the fact that
      wearisome vigils had been kept in every home that night, and that hundreds
      of men and women had stood about for hours in the vicinity of the Gayole
      Fort, no sooner was the joyful news known, than all lassitude was
      forgotten and everyone set to with a right merry will to make the great
      fete-day a complete success.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in every native of Normandy, be he peasant or gentleman, an
      infinite capacity for enjoyment, and at the same time a marvellous faculty
      for co-ordinating and systematizing his pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a trice the surly crowds had vanished. Instead of these, there were
      groups of gaily-visaged men pleasantly chattering outside every eating and
      drinking place in the town. The national holiday had come upon these
      people quite unawares, so the early part of it had to be spent in thinking
      out a satisfactory programme for it. Sipping their beer or coffee, or
      munching their cherries a l'eau-de-vie, the townsfolk of Boulogne, so
      lately threatened with death, were quietly organizing processions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was to be a grand muster on the Place de la Senechaussee, then a
      torchlight and lanthorn-light march, right round the Ramparts, culminating
      in a gigantic assembly outside the Town Hall, where the Citizen Chauvelin,
      representing the Committee of Public Safety, would receive an address of
      welcome from the entire population of Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession was to be in costume! There were to be Pierrots and
      Pierettes, Harlequins and English clowns, aristocrats and goddesses! All
      day the women and girls were busy contriving travesties of all sorts, and
      the little tumbledown shops in the Rue de Chateau and the Rue Frederic
      Sauvage—kept chiefly by Jews and English traders—were
      ransacked for old bits of finery, and for remnants of costumes, worn in
      the days when Boulogne was still a gay city and Carnivals were held every
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, of course, there would be the Goddess of Reason, in her
      triumphal car! the apotheosis of the new religion, which was to make
      everybody happy, rich and free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten were the anxieties of the night, the fears of death, the great
      and glorious Revolution, which for this one day would cease her perpetual
      demand for the toll of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was remembered save the pleasures and joys of the moment, and at
      times the name of that Englishman—spy, hero or adventurer—the
      cause of all this bounty: the Scarlet Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXX: The Procession
    </h2>
    <p>
      The grandfathers of the present generation of Boulonnese remembered the
      great day of the National Fete, when all Boulogne, for twenty-four hours,
      went crazy with joy. So many families had fathers, brothers, sons,
      languishing in prison under some charge of treason, real or imaginary; so
      many had dear ones for whom already the guillotine loomed ahead, that the
      feast on this memorable day of September, 1793, was one of
      never-to-be-forgotten relief and thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather all day had been exceptionally fine. After that glorious
      sunrise, the sky had remained all day clad in its gorgeous mantle of blue
      and the sun had continued to smile benignly on the many varied doings of
      this gay, little seaport town. When it began to sink slowly towards the
      West a few little fluffy clouds appeared on the horizon, and from a
      distance, although the sky remained clear and blue, the sea looked quite
      dark and slaty against the brilliance of the firmament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, as the splendour of the sunset gave place to the delicate
      purple and grey tints of evening, the little fluffy clouds merged
      themselves into denser masses, and these too soon became absorbed in the
      great, billowy banks which the southwesterly wind was blowing seawards.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that the last grey streak of dusk vanished in the West, the
      whole sky looked heavy with clouds, and the evening set in, threatening
      and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this by no means mitigated the anticipation of pleasure to come. On
      the contrary, the fast-gathering gloom was hailed with delight, since it
      would surely help to show off the coloured lights of the lanthorns, and
      give additional value to the glow of the torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a truth 'twas a motley throng which began to assemble on the Place de
      la Senechaussee, just as the old bell of the Beffroi tolled the hour of
      six. Men, women and children in ragged finery, Pierrots with neck frills
      and floured faces, hideous masks of impossible beasts roughly besmeared in
      crude colours. There were gaily-coloured dominoes, blue, green, pink and
      purple, harlequins combining all the colours of the rainbow in one
      tight-fitting garment, and Columbines with short, tarlatan skirts, beneath
      which peeped bare feet and ankles. There were judges' perruques, and
      soldiers' helmets of past generations, tall Normandy caps adorned with
      hundreds of streaming ribbons, and powdered headgear which recalled the
      glories of Versailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was torn and dirty, the dominoes were in rags, the Pierrot
      frills, mostly made up of paper, already hung in strips over the wearers'
      shoulders. But what mattered that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd pushed and jolted, shouted and laughed, the girls screamed as
      the men snatched a kiss here and there from willing or unwilling lips, or
      stole an arm round a gaily accoutred waist. The spirit of Old King
      Carnival was in the evening air—a spirit just awakened from a long
      Rip van Winkle-like sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the Place stood the guillotine, grim and gaunt with long,
      thin arms stretched out towards the sky, the last glimmer of waning light
      striking the triangular knife, there, where it was not rusty with stains
      of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks now Madame Guillotine had been much occupied plying her gruesome
      trade; she now stood there in the gloom, passive and immovable, seeming to
      wait placidly for the end of this holiday, ready to begin her work again
      on the morrow. She towered above these merrymakers, hoisted up on the
      platform whereon many an innocent foot had trodden, the tattered basket
      beside her, into which many an innocent head had rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      What cared they to-night for Madame Guillotine and the horrors of which
      she told? A crowd of Pierrots with floured faces and tattered neck-frills
      had just swarmed up the wooden steps, shouting and laughing, chasing each
      other round and round on the platform, until one of them lost his footing
      and fell into the basket, covering himself with bran and staining his
      clothes with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah! vogue la galere! We must be merry to-night!”
     </p>
    <p>
      And all these people who for weeks past had been staring death and the
      guillotine in the face, had denounced each other with savage callousness
      in order to save themselves, or hidden for days in dark cellars to escape
      apprehension, now laughed, and danced and shrieked with gladness in a
      sudden, hysterical outburst of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close beside the guillotine stood the triumphal car of the Goddess of
      Reason, the special feature of this great national fete. It was only a
      rough market cart, painted by an unpractised hand with bright, crimson
      paint and adorned with huge clusters of autumn-tinted leaves, and the
      scarlet berries of mountain ash and rowan, culled from the town gardens,
      or the country side outside the city walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cart the goddess reclined on a crimson-draped seat, she, herself,
      swathed in white, and wearing a gorgeous necklace around her neck. Desiree
      Candeille, a little pale, a little apprehensive of all this noise, had
      obeyed the final dictates of her taskmaster. She had been the means of
      bringing the Scarlet Pimpernel to France and vengeance, she was to be
      honoured therefore above every other woman in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat in the car, vaguely thinking over the events of the past few days,
      whilst watching the throng of rowdy merrymakers seething around her. She
      thought of the noble-hearted, proud woman whom she had helped to bring
      from her beautiful English home to sorrow and humiliation in a dank French
      prison, she thought of the gallant English gentleman with his pleasant
      voice and courtly, debonnair manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had roughly told her, only this morning, that both were now
      under arrest as English spies, and that their fate no longer concerned
      her. Later on the governor of the city had come to tell her that Citizen
      Chauvelin desired her to take part in the procession and the national
      fete, as the Goddess of Reason, and that the people of Boulogne were ready
      to welcome her as such. This had pleased Candeille's vanity, and all day,
      whilst arranging the finery which she meant to wear for the occasion, she
      had ceased to think of England and of Lady Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, when she arrived on the Place de la Senechaussee, and mounting
      her car, found herself on a level with the platform of the guillotine, her
      memory flew back to England, to the lavish hospitality of Blakeney Manor,
      Marguerite's gentle voice, the pleasing grace of Sir Percy's manners, and
      she shuddered a little when that cruel glint of evening light caused the
      knife of the guillotine to glisten from out the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But anon her reflections were suddenly interrupted by loud and prolonged
      shouts of joy. A whole throng of Pierrots had swarmed into the Place from
      every side, carrying lighted torches and tall staves, on which were hung
      lanthorns with many-coloured lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procession was ready to start. A stentorian voice shouted out in
      resonant accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      “En avant, la grosse caisse!”
     </p>
    <p>
      A man now, portly and gorgeous in scarlet and blue, detached himself from
      out the crowd. His head was hidden beneath the monstrous mask of a
      cardboard lion, roughly painted in brown and yellow, with crimson for the
      widely open jaws and the corners of the eyes, to make them seem ferocious
      and bloodshot. His coat was of bright crimson cloth, with cuts and
      slashings in it, through which bunches of bright blue paper were made to
      protrude, in imitation of the costume of mediaeval times.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had blue stockings on and bright scarlet slippers, and behind him
      floated a large strip of scarlet flannel, on which moons and suns and
      stars of gold had been showered in plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his portly figure in front he was supporting the big drum, which was
      securely strapped round his shoulders with tarred cordages, the spoil of
      some fishing vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a merciful slit in the jaw of the cardboard lion, through which
      the portly drummer puffed and spluttered as he shouted lustily:
    </p>
    <p>
      “En avant!”
     </p>
    <p>
      And wielding the heavy drumstick with a powerful arm, he brought it
      crashing down against the side of the mighty instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah! Hurrah! en avant les trompettes!”
     </p>
    <p>
      A fanfare of brass instruments followed, lustily blown by twelve young men
      in motley coats of green, and tall, peaked hats adorned with feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drummer had begun to march, closely followed by the trumpeters. Behind
      them a bevy of Columbines in many-coloured tarlatan skirts and hair flying
      wildly in the breeze, giggling, pushing, exchanging ribald jokes with the
      men behind, and getting kissed or slapped for their pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the triumphal car of the goddess, with Demoiselle Candeille standing
      straight up in it, a tall gold wand in one hand, the other resting in a
      mass of scarlet berries. All round the car, helter-skelter, tumbling,
      pushing, came Pierrots and Pierrettes, carrying lanthorns, and Harlequins
      bearing the torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after the car the long line of more sober folk, the older fishermen,
      the women in caps and many-hued skirts, the serious townfolk who had
      scorned the travesty, yet would not be left out of the procession. They
      all began to march, to the tune of those noisy brass trumpets which were
      thundering forth snatches from the newly composed “Marseillaise.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Above the sky became more heavy with clouds. Anon a few drops of rain
      began to fall, making the torches sizzle and splutter, and scatter grease
      and tar around and wetting the lightly-covered shoulders of tarlatan-clad
      Columbines. But no one cared! The glow of so much merrymaking kept the
      blood warm and the skin dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flour all came off the Pierrots' faces, the blue paper slashings of
      the drummer-in-chief hung in pulpy lumps against his gorgeous scarlet
      cloak. The trumpeters' feathers became streaky and bedraggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the name of that good God who had ceased to exist, who in the world
      or out of it cared if it rained, or thundered and stormed! This was a
      national holiday, for an English spy was captured, and all natives of
      Boulogne were free of the guillotine to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The revellers were making the circuit of the town, with lanthorns
      fluttering in the wind, and flickering torches held up aloft illumining
      laughing faces, red with the glow of a drunken joy, young faces that only
      enjoyed the moment's pleasure, serious ones that withheld a frown at
      thought of the morrow. The fitful light played on the grotesque masques of
      beasts and reptiles, on the diamond necklace of a very earthly goddess, on
      God's glorious spoils from gardens and country-side, on smothered anxiety
      and repressed cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd had turned its back on the guillotine, and the trumpets now
      changed the inspiriting tune of the “Marseillaise” to the ribald vulgarity
      of the “Ca ira!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone yelled and shouted. Girls with flowing hair produced broomsticks,
      and astride on these, broke from the ranks and danced a mad and obscene
      saraband, a dance of witches in the weird glow of sizzling torches, to the
      accompaniment of raucous laughter and of coarse jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the procession passed on, a sight to gladden the eyes of those who
      had desired to smother all thought of the Infinite, of Eternity and of God
      in the minds of those to whom they had nothing to offer in return. A
      threat of death yesterday, misery, starvation and squalor! all the
      hideousness of a destroying anarchy, that had nothing to give save a
      national fete, a tinsel goddess, some shallow laughter and momentary
      intoxication, a travesty of clothes and of religion and a dance on the
      ashes of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there along the ramparts where the massive walls of the city encircled
      the frowning prisons of Gayole and the old Chateau, dark groups were
      crouching, huddled together in compact masses, which in the gloom seemed
      to vibrate with fear. Like hunted quarry seeking for shelter, sombre
      figures flattened themselves in the angles of the dank walls, as the noisy
      carousers drew nigh. Then as the torches and lanthorns detached themselves
      from out the evening shadows, hand would clutch hand and hearts would beat
      with agonized suspense, whilst the dark and shapeless forms would try to
      appear smaller, flatter, less noticeable than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the crowd had passed noisily along, leaving behind it a trail of
      torn finery, of glittering tinsel and of scarlet berries, when the boom of
      the big drum and the grating noise of the brass trumpets had somewhat died
      away, wan faces, pale with anxiety, would peer from out the darkness, and
      nervous hands would grasp with trembling fingers the small bundles of poor
      belongings tied up hastily in view of flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock, so 'twas said, the cannon would boom from the old
      Beffroi. The guard would throw open the prison gates, and those who had
      something or somebody to hide, and those who had a great deal to fear,
      would be free to go whithersoever they chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And mothers, sisters, sweethearts stood watching by the gates, for loved
      ones to-night would be set free, all along of the capture of that English
      spy, the Scarlet Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXXI: Final Dispositions
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Chauvelin the day had been one of restless inquietude and nervous
      apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collot d'Herbois harassed him with questions and complaints intermixed
      with threats but thinly veiled. At his suggestion Gayole had been
      transformed into a fully-manned, well-garrisoned fortress. Troops were to
      be seen everywhere, on the stairs and in the passages, the guard-rooms and
      offices: picked men from the municipal guard, and the company which had
      been sent down from Paris some time ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had not resisted these orders given by his colleague. He knew
      quite well that Marguerite would make no attempt at escape, but he had
      long ago given up all hope of persuading a man of the type of Collot
      d'Herbois that a woman of her temperament would never think of saving her
      own life at the expense of others, and that Sir Percy Blakeney, in spite
      of his adoration for his wife, would sooner see her die before him, than
      allow the lives of innocent men and women to be the price of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collot was one of those brutish sots—not by any means infrequent
      among the Terrorists of that time—who, born in the gutter, still
      loved to wallow in his native element, and who measured all his
      fellow-creatures by the same standard which he had always found good
      enough for himself. In this man there was neither the enthusiastic
      patriotism of a Chauvelin, nor the ardent selflessness of a Danton. He
      served the revolution and fostered the anarchical spirit of the times only
      because these brought him a competence and a notoriety, which an orderly
      and fastidious government would obviously have never offered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      History shows no more despicable personality than that of Collot
      d'Herbois, one of the most hideous products of that utopian Revolution,
      whose grandly conceived theories of a universal levelling of mankind only
      succeeded in dragging into prominence a number of half-brutish creatures
      who, revelling in their own abasement, would otherwise have remained
      content in inglorious obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin tolerated and half feared Collot, knowing full well that if now
      the Scarlet Pimpernel escaped from his hands, he could expect no mercy
      from his colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scheme by which he hoped to destroy not only the heroic leader but the
      entire League by bringing opprobrium and ridicule upon them, was
      wonderfully subtle in its refined cruelty, and Chauvelin, knowing by now
      something of Sir Percy Blakeney's curiously blended character, was never
      for a moment in doubt but that he would write the infamous letter, save
      his wife by sacrificing his honour, and then seek oblivion and peace in
      suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
      With so much disgrace, so much mud cast upon their chief, the League of
      the Scarlet Pimpernel would cease to be. THAT had been Chauvelin's plan
      all along. For this end he had schemed and thought and planned, from the
      moment that Robespierre had given him the opportunity of redeeming his
      failure of last year. He had built up the edifice of his intrigue, bit by
      bit, from the introduction of his tool, Candeille, to Marguerite at the
      Richmond gala, to the arrest of Lady Blakeney in Boulogne. All that
      remained for him to see now, would be the attitude of Sir Percy Blakeney
      to-night, when, in exchange for the stipulated letter, he would see his
      wife set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day Chauvelin had wondered how it would all go off. He had
      stage-managed everything, but he did not know how the chief actor would
      play his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, when his feeling of restlessness became quite
      unendurable, the ex-ambassador would wander round Fort Gayole and on some
      pretext or other demand to see one or the other of his prisoners.
      Marguerite, however, observed complete silence in his presence: she
      acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of the head, and in
      reply to certain perfunctory queries of his—which he put to her in
      order to justify his appearance—she either nodded or gave curt
      monosyllabic answers through partially closed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I trust that everything is arranged for your comfort, Lady Blakeney.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, sir.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You will be rejoining the 'Day-Dream' to-night. Can I send a messenger
      over to the yacht for you?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you. No.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir Percy is well. He is fast asleep, and hath not asked for your
      ladyship. Shall I let him know that you are well?”
     </p>
    <p>
      A nod of acquiescence from Marguerite and Chauvelin's string of queries
      was at an end. He marvelled at her quietude and thought that she should
      have been as restless as himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on in the day, and egged on by Collot d'Herbois and by his own
      fears, he had caused Marguerite to be removed from No. 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      This change he heralded by another brief visit to her, and his attitude
      this time was one of deferential apology.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A matter of expediency, Lady Blakeney,” he explained, “and I trust that
      the change will be for your comfort.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the same curt nod of acquiescence on her part, and a brief:
    </p>
    <p>
      “As you command, Monsieur!”
     </p>
    <p>
      But when he had gone, she turned with a sudden passionate outburst towards
      the Abbe Foucquet, her faithful companion through the past long, weary
      hours. She fell on her knees beside him and sobbed in an agony of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! if I could only know... if I could only see him!... for a minute... a
      second!... if I could only know!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt as if the awful uncertainty would drive her mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she could only know! If she could only know what he meant to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The good God knows!” said the old man, with his usual simple philosophy,
      “and perhaps it is all for the best.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The room which Chauvelin had now destined for Marguerite was one which
      gave from the larger one, wherein last night he had had his momentous
      interview with her and with Sir Percy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was small, square and dark, with no window in it: only a small
      ventilating hole high up in the wall and heavily grated. Chauvelin, who
      desired to prove to her that there was no wish on his part to add physical
      discomfort to her mental tortures, had given orders that the little place
      should be made as habitable as possible. A thick, soft carpet had been
      laid on the ground; there was an easy chair and a comfortable-looking
      couch with a couple of pillows and a rug upon it, and oh, marvel! on the
      round central table, a vase with a huge bunch of many-coloured dahlias
      which seemed to throw a note as if of gladness into this strange and
      gloomy little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the furthest corner, too, a construction of iron uprights and crossway
      bars had been hastily contrived and fitted with curtains, forming a small
      recess, behind which was a tidy washstand, fine clean towels and plenty of
      fresh water. Evidently the shops of Boulogne had been commandeered in
      order to render Marguerite's sojourn here outwardly agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the place was innocent of window, so was it innocent of doors. The
      one that gave into the large room had been taken out of its hinges,
      leaving only the frame, on each side of which stood a man from the
      municipal guard with fixed bayonet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin himself had conducted Marguerite to her new prison. She followed
      him—silent and apathetic—with not a trace of that awful
      torrent of emotion which had overwhelmed her but half-an-hour ago when she
      had fallen on her knees beside the old priest and sobbed her heart out in
      a passionate fit of weeping. Even the sight of the soldiers left her
      outwardly indifferent. As she stepped across the threshold she noticed
      that the door itself had been taken away: then she gave another quick
      glance at the soldiers, whose presence there would control her every
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of Queen Marie Antoinette in the Conciergerie prison with the
      daily, hourly humiliation and shame which this constant watch imposed upon
      her womanly pride and modesty, flashed suddenly across Marguerite's mind,
      and a deep blush of horror rapidly suffused her pale cheeks, whilst an
      almost imperceptible shudder shook her delicate frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, as in a flash, she had at this moment received an inkling of what
      the nature of that terrible “either—or” might be, with which
      Chauvelin was trying to force an English gentleman to dishonour. Sir Percy
      Blakeney's wife had been threatened with Marie Antoinette's fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You see, Madame,” said her cruel enemy's unctuous voice close to her ear,
      “that we have tried our humble best to make your brief sojourn here as
      agreeable as possible. May I express a hope that you will be quite
      comfortable in this room, until the time when Sir Percy will be ready to
      accompany you to the 'Day-Dream.'”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I thank you, sir,” she replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if there is anything you require, I pray you to call. I shall be in
      the next room all day and entirely at your service.”
     </p>
    <p>
      A young orderly now entered bearing a small collation—eggs, bread,
      milk and wine—which he set on the central table. Chauvelin bowed low
      before Marguerite and withdrew. Anon he ordered the two sentinels to stand
      the other side of the doorway, against the wall of his own room, and well
      out of sight of Marguerite, so that, as she moved about her own narrow
      prison, if she ate or slept, she might have the illusion that she was
      unwatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the soldiers had had the desired effect on her. Chauvelin had
      seen her shudder and knew that she understood or that she guessed. He was
      now satisfied and really had no wish to harass her beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there was always the proclamation which threatened the
      bread-winners of Boulogne with death if Marguerite Blakeney escaped, and
      which would be in full force until Sir Percy had written, signed and
      delivered into Chauvelin's hands the letter which was to be the signal for
      the general amnesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had indeed cause to be satisfied with his measures. There was no
      fear that his prisoners would attempt to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Collot d'Herbois had to admit everything was well done. He had read
      the draft of the proposed letter and was satisfied with its contents.
      Gradually now into his loutish brain there had filtrated the conviction
      that Citizen Chauvelin was right, that that accursed Scarlet Pimpernel and
      his brood of English spies would be more effectually annihilated by all
      the dishonour and ridicule which such a letter written by the mysterious
      hero would heap upon them all, than they could ever be through the
      relentless work of the guillotine. His only anxiety now was whether the
      Englishman would write that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Bah! he'll do it,” he would say whenever he thought the whole matter
      over: “Sacre tonnerre! but 'tis an easy means to save his own skin.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You would sign such a letter without hesitation, eh, Citizen Collot,”
       said Chauvelin, with well-concealed sarcasm, on one occasion when his
      colleague discussed the all-absorbing topic with him; “you would show no
      hesitation, if your life were at stake, and you were given the choice
      between writing that letter and... the guillotine?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Parbleu!” responded Collot with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      “More especially,” continued Chauvelin drily, “if a million francs were
      promised you as well?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sacre Anglais!” swore Collot angrily, “you don't propose giving him that
      money, do you?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “We'll place it ready to his hand, at any rate, so that it should appear
      as if he had actually taken it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Collot looked up at his colleague in ungrudging admiration. Chauvelin had
      indeed left nothing undone, had thought everything out in this strangely
      conceived scheme for the destruction of the enemy of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But in the name of all the dwellers in hell, Citizen,” admonished Collot,
      “guard that letter well, once it is in your hands.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I'll do better than that,” said Chauvelin, “I will hand it over to you,
      Citizen Collot, and you shall ride with it to Paris at once.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “To-night!” assented Collot with a shout of triumph, as he brought his
      grimy fist crashing down on the table, “I'll have a horse ready saddled at
      this very gate, and an escort of mounted men... we'll ride like hell's own
      furies and not pause to breathe until that letter is in Citizen
      Robespierre's hands.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Well thought of, Citizen,” said Chauvelin approvingly. “I pray you give
      the necessary orders, that the horses be ready saddled, and the men booted
      and spurred, and waiting at the Gayole gate, at seven o'clock this
      evening.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I wish the letter were written and safely in our hands by now.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! the Englishman will have it ready by this evening, never fear. The
      tide is high at half-past seven, and he will be in haste for his wife to
      be aboard his yacht, ere the turn, even if he...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, savouring the thoughts which had suddenly flashed across his
      mind, and a look of intense hatred and cruel satisfaction for a moment
      chased away the studied impassiveness of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you mean, Citizen?” queried Collot anxiously, “even if he...
      what?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! nothing, nothing! I was only trying to make vague guesses as to what
      the Englishman will do AFTER he has written the letter,” quoth Chauvelin
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Morbleu! he'll return to his own accursed country... glad enough to have
      escaped with his skin.... I suppose,” added Collot with sudden anxiety,
      “you have no fear that he will refuse at the last moment to write that
      letter?”
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were sitting in the large room, out of which opened the one
      which was now occupied by Marguerite. They were talking at the further end
      of it, close to the window, and though Chauvelin had mostly spoken in a
      whisper, Collot had ofttimes shouted, and the ex-ambassador was wondering
      how much Marguerite had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at Collot's anxious query he gave a quick furtive glance in the
      direction of the further room wherein she sat, so silent and so still,
      that it seemed almost as if she must be sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don't think that the Englishman will refuse to write the letter?”
       insisted Collot with angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No!” replied Chauvelin quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But if he does?” persisted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If he does, I send the woman to Paris to-night and have him hanged as a
      spy in this prison yard without further formality or trial...” replied
      Chauvelin firmly; “so either way, you see, Citizen,” he added in a
      whisper, “the Scarlet Pimpernel is done for.... But I think that he will
      write the letter.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Parbleu! so do I!...” rejoined Collot with a coarse laugh.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXXII: The Letter
    </h2>
    <p>
      Later on, when his colleague left him in order to see to the horses and to
      his escort for to-night, Chauvelin called Sergeant Hebert, his old and
      trusted familiar, to him and gave him some final orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Angelus must be rung at the proper hour, friend Hebert,” he began
      with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Angelus, Citizen?” quoth the Sergeant, with complete stupefaction,
      “'tis months now since it has been rung. It was forbidden by a decree of
      the Convention, and I doubt me if any of our men would know how to set
      about it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin's eyes were fixed before him in apparent vacancy, while the same
      grim smile still hovered round his thin lips. Something of that
      irresponsible spirit of adventure which was the mainspring of all Sir
      Percy Blakeney's actions, must for the moment have pervaded the mind of
      his deadly enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had thought out this idea of having the Angelus rung to-night,
      and was thoroughly pleased with the notion. This was the day when the duel
      was to have been fought; seven o'clock would have been the very hour, and
      the sound of the Angelus to have been the signal for combat, and there was
      something very satisfying in the thought, that that same Angelus should be
      rung, as a signal that the Scarlet Pimpernel was withered and broken at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to Hebert's look of bewilderment Chauvelin said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We must have some signal between ourselves and the guard at the different
      gates, also with the harbour officials: at a given moment the general
      amnesty must take effect and the harbour become a free port. I have a
      fancy that the signal shall be the ringing of the Angelus: the cannons at
      the gates and the harbour can boom in response; then the prisons can be
      thrown open and prisoners can either participate in the evening fete or
      leave the city immediately, as they choose. The Committee of Public Safety
      has promised the amnesty: it will carry out its promise to the full, and
      when Citizen Collot d'Herbois arrives in Paris with the joyful news, all
      natives of Boulogne in the prisons there will participate in the free
      pardon too.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I understand all that, Citizen,” said Hebert, still somewhat bewildered,
      “but not the Angelus.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A fancy, friend Hebert, and I mean to have it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “But who is to ring it, Citizen?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Morbleu! haven't you one calotin left in Boulogne whom you can press into
      doing this service?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! calotins enough! there's the Abbe Foucquet in this very building...
      in No. 6 cell...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sacre tonnerre!” ejaculated Chauvelin exultingly, “the very man! I know
      his dossier well! Once he is free, he will make straightway for England...
      he and his family... and will help to spread the glorious news of the
      dishonour and disgrace of the much-vaunted Scarlet Pimpernel!... The very
      man, friend Hebert!... Let him be stationed here... to see the letter
      written... to see the money handed over—for we will go through with
      that farce—and make him understand that the moment I give him the
      order, he can run over to his old church St. Joseph and ring the Angelus.
      ... The old fool will be delighted... more especially when he knows that
      he will thereby be giving the very signal which will set his own sister's
      children free.... You understand?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I understand, Citizen.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “And you can make the old calotin understand?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I think so, Citizen.... You want him in this room.... At what time?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “A quarter before seven.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes. I'll bring him along myself, and stand over him, lest he play any
      pranks.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Oh! he'll not trouble you,” sneered Chauvelin, “he'll be deeply
      interested in the proceedings. The woman will be here too, remember,” he
      added with a jerky movement of the hand in the direction of Marguerite's
      room, “the two might be made to stand together, with four of your fellows
      round them.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I understand, Citizen. Are any of us to escort the Citizen Foucquet when
      he goes to St. Joseph?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! two men had best go with him. There will be a crowd in the streets
      by then... How far is it from here to the church?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Less than five minutes.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Good. See to it that the doors are opened and the bell ropes easy of
      access.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It shall be seen to, Citizen. How many men will you have inside this room
      to-night?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Let the walls be lined with men whom you can trust. I anticipate neither
      trouble nor resistance. The whole thing is a simple formality to which the
      Englishman has already intimated his readiness to submit. If he changes
      his mind at the last moment there will be no Angelus rung, no booming of
      the cannons or opening of the prison doors: there will be no amnesty, and
      no free pardon. The woman will be at once conveyed to Paris, and... But
      he'll not change his mind, friend Hebert,” he concluded in suddenly
      altered tones, and speaking quite lightly, “he'll not change his mind.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation between Chauvelin and his familiar had been carried on in
      whispers: not that the Terrorist cared whether Marguerite overheard or
      not, but whispering had become a habit with this man, whose tortuous ways
      and subtle intrigues did not lend themselves to discussion in a loud
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin was sitting at the central table, just where he had been last
      night when Sir Percy Blakeney's sudden advent broke in on his meditations.
      The table had been cleared of the litter of multitudinous papers which had
      encumbered it before. On it now there were only a couple of heavy pewter
      candlesticks, with the tallow candles fixed ready in them, a leather-pad,
      an ink-well, a sand-box and two or three quill pens: everything disposed,
      in fact, for the writing and signing of the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already in imagination, Chauvelin saw his impudent enemy, the bold and
      daring adventurer, standing there beside that table and putting his name
      to the consummation of his own infamy. The mental picture thus evoked
      brought a gleam of cruel satisfaction and of satiated lust into the keen,
      ferret-like face, and a smile of intense joy lit up the narrow,
      pale-coloured eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room where the great scene would be enacted: two
      soldiers were standing guard outside Marguerite's prison, two more at
      attention near the door which gave on the passage: his own half-dozen
      picked men were waiting his commands in the corridor. Presently the whole
      room would be lined with troops, himself and Collot standing with eyes
      fixed on the principal actor of the drama! Hebert with specially selected
      troopers standing on guard over Marguerite!
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no! he had left nothing to chance this time, and down below the horses
      would be ready saddled, that were to convey Collot and the precious
      document to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! nothing was left to chance, and in either case he was bound to win.
      Sir Percy Blakeney would either write the letter in order to save his
      wife, and heap dishonour on himself, or he would shrink from the terrible
      ordeal at the last moment and let Chauvelin and the Committee of Public
      Safety work their will with her and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “In that case the pillory as a spy and summary hanging for you, my
      friend,” concluded Chauvelin in his mind, “and for your wife... Bah, once
      you are out of the way, even she will cease to matter.”
     </p>
    <p>
      He left Hebert on guard in the room. An irresistible desire seized him to
      go and have a look at his discomfited enemy, and from the latter's
      attitude make a shrewd guess as to what he meant to do to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy had been given a room on one of the upper floors of the old
      prison. He had in no way been closely guarded, and the room itself had
      been made as comfortable as may be. He had seemed quite happy and
      contented when he had been conducted hither by Chauvelin, the evening
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hope you quite understand, Sir Percy, that you are my guest here
      to-night,” Chauvelin had said suavely, “and that you are free to come and
      go, just as you please.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Lud love you, sir,” Sir Percy had replied gaily, “but I verily believe
      that I am.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It is only Lady Blakeney whom we have cause to watch until to-morrow,”
       added Chauvelin with quiet significance. “Is that not so, Sir Percy?”
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Percy seemed, whenever his wife's name was mentioned, to lapse
      into irresistible somnolence. He yawned now with his usual affectation,
      and asked at what hour gentlemen in France were wont to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then Chauvelin had not seen him. He had repeatedly asked how the
      English prisoner was faring, and whether he seemed to be sleeping and
      eating heartily. The orderly in charge invariably reported that the
      Englishman seemed well, but did not eat much. On the other hand, he had
      ordered, and lavishly paid for, measure after measure of brandy and bottle
      after bottle of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hm! how strange these Englishmen are!” mused Chauvelin; “this so-called
      hero is nothing but a wine-sodden brute, who seeks to nerve himself for a
      trying ordeal by drowning his faculties in brandy... Perhaps after all he
      doesn't care!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      But the wish to have a look at that strangely complex creature—hero,
      adventurer or mere lucky fool—was irresistible, and Chauvelin in the
      latter part of the afternoon went up to the room which had been allotted
      to Sir Percy Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never moved now without his escort, and this time also two of his
      favourite bodyguards accompanied him to the upper floor. He knocked at the
      door, but received no answer, and after a second or two he bade his men
      wait in the corridor and, gently turning the latch, walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an odour of brandy in the air; on the table two or three empty
      bottles of wine and a glass half filled with cognac testified to the truth
      of what the orderly had said, whilst sprawling across the camp bedstead,
      which obviously was too small for his long limbs, his head thrown back,
      his mouth open for a vigorous snore, lay the imperturbable Sir Percy fast
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin went up to the bedstead and looked down upon the reclining
      figure of the man who had oft been called the most dangerous enemy of
      Republican France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a truth, a fine figure of a man, Chauvelin was ready enough to admit
      that; the long, hard limbs, the wide chest, and slender, white hands, all
      bespoke the man of birth, breeding and energy: the face too looked strong
      and clearly-cut in repose, now that the perpetually inane smile did not
      play round the firm lips, nor the lazy, indolent expression mar the
      seriousness of the straight brow. For one moment—it was a mere flash—Chauvelin
      felt almost sorry that so interesting a career should be thus
      ignominiously brought to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Terrorist felt that if his own future, his own honour and integrity
      were about to be so hopelessly crushed, he would have wandered up and down
      this narrow room like a caged beast, eating out his heart with
      self-reproach and remorse, and racking his nerves and brain for an issue
      out of the terrible alternative which meant dishonour or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this man drank and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps he doesn't care!”
     </p>
    <p>
      And as if in answer to Chauvelin's puzzled musing a deep snore escaped the
      sleeping adventurer's parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin sighed, perplexed and troubled. He looked round the little room,
      then went up to a small side table which stood against the wall and on
      which were two or three quill pens and an ink-well, also some loosely
      scattered sheets of paper. These he turned over with a careless hand and
      presently came across a closely written page. —— “Citizen
      Chauvelin:—In consideration of a further sum of one million
      francs...”
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of the letter!... only a few words so far... with
      several corrections of misspelt words... and a line left out here and
      there which confused the meaning... a beginning made by the unsteady hand
      of that drunken fool... an attempt only at present....
    </p>
    <p>
      But still... a beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by was the draft of it as written out by Chauvelin, and which Sir
      Percy had evidently begun to copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made up his mind then.... He meant to subscribe with his own hand
      to his lasting dishonour... and meaning it, he slept!
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin felt the paper trembling in his hand. He felt strangely agitated
      and nervous, now that the issue was so near... so sure!...
    </p>
    <p>
      “There's no demmed hurry for that, is there... er... Monsieur
      Chaubertin?...” came from the slowly wakening Sir Percy in somewhat thick,
      heavy accents, accompanied by a prolonged yawn. “I haven't got the demmed
      thing quite ready...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin had been so startled that the paper dropped from his hand. He
      stooped to pick it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay! why should you be so scared, sir?” continued Sir Percy lazily, “did
      you think I was drunk?... I assure you, sir, on my honour, I am not so
      drunk as you think I am.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I have no doubt, Sir Percy,” replied Chauvelin ironically, “that you have
      all your marvellous faculties entirely at your command.... I must
      apologize for disturbing your papers,” he added, replacing the
      half-written page on the table, “I thought perhaps that if the letter was
      ready ...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “It will be, sir... it will be... for I am not drunk, I assure you.... and
      can write with a steady hand... and do honour to my signature....”
     </p>
    <p>
      “When will you have the letter ready, Sir Percy?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “The 'Day-Dream' must leave the harbour at the turn of the tide,” quoth
      Sir Percy thickly. “It'll be demmed well time by then... won't it,
      sir?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “About sundown, Sir Percy... not later...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “About sundown... not later...” muttered Blakeney, as he once more
      stretched his long limbs along the narrow bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a loud and hearty yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'll not fail you...” he murmured, as he closed his eyes, and gave a
      final struggle to get his head at a comfortable angle, “the letter will be
      written in my best cali... calig.... Lud! but I'm not so drunk as you
      think I am. ...”
     </p>
    <p>
      But as if to belie his own oft-repeated assertion, hardly was the last
      word out of his mouth than his stertorous and even breathing proclaimed
      the fact that he was once more fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shrug of the shoulders and a look of unutterable contempt at his
      broken-down enemy, Chauvelin turned on his heel and went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But outside in the corridor he called the orderly to him and gave strict
      commands that no more wine or brandy was to be served to the Englishman
      under any circumstances whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He has two hours in which to sleep off the effects of all that brandy
      which he had consumed,” he mused as he finally went back to his own
      quarters, “and by that time he will be able to write with a steady hand.”
     </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIII: The English Spy
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now at last the shades of evening were drawing in thick and fast.
      Within the walls of Fort Gayole the last rays of the setting sun had long
      ago ceased to shed their dying radiance, and through the thick stone
      embrasures and the dusty panes of glass, the grey light of dusk soon
      failed to penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the large ground-floor room with its window opened upon the wide
      promenade of the southern ramparts, a silence reigned which was
      oppressive. The air was heavy with the fumes of the two tallow candles on
      the table, which smoked persistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the walls a row of figures in dark blue uniforms with scarlet
      facings, drab breeches and heavy riding boots, silent and immovable, with
      fixed bayonets like so many automatons lining the room all round; at some
      little distance from the central table and out of the immediate circle of
      light, a small group composed of five soldiers in the same blue and
      scarlet uniforms. One of these was Sergeant Hebert. In the centre of this
      group two persons were sitting: a woman and an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Foucquet had been brought down from his prison cell a few minutes
      ago, and told to watch what would go on around him, after which he would
      be allowed to go to his old church of St. Joseph and ring the Angelus once
      more before he and his family left Boulogne forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Angelus would be the signal for the opening of all the prison gates in
      the town. Everyone to-night could come and go as they pleased, and having
      rung the Angelus, the abbe would be at liberty to join Francois and
      Felicite and their old mother, his sister, outside the purlieus of the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe Foucquet did not quite understand all this, which was very
      rapidly and roughly explained to him. It was such a very little while ago
      that he had expected to see the innocent children mounting up those awful
      steps which lead to the guillotine, whilst he himself was looking death
      quite near in the face, that all this talk of amnesty and of pardon had
      not quite fully reached his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was quite content that it had all been ordained by le bon Dieu, and
      very happy at the thought of ringing the dearly-loved Angelus in his own
      old church once again. So when he was peremptorily pushed into the room
      and found himself close to Marguerite, with four or five soldiers standing
      round them, he quietly pulled his old rosary from his pocket and began
      murmuring gentle “Paters” and “Aves” under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him sat Marguerite, rigid as a statue: her cloak thrown over her
      shoulders, so that its hood might hide her face. She could not now have
      said how that awful day had passed, how she had managed to survive the
      terrible, nerve-racking suspense, the agonizing doubt as to what was going
      to happen. But above all, what she had found most unendurable was the
      torturing thought that in this same grim and frowning building her husband
      was there... somewhere... how far or how near she could not say... but she
      knew that she was parted from him and perhaps would not see him again, not
      even at the hour of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Percy would never write that infamous letter and LIVE, she knew. That
      he might write it in order to save her, she feared was possible, whilst
      the look of triumph on Chauvelin's face had aroused her most agonizing
      terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was summarily ordered to go into the next room, she realized at
      once that all hope now was more than futile. The walls lined with troops,
      the attitude of her enemies, and above all that table with paper, ink and
      pens ready as it were for the accomplishment of the hideous and monstrous
      deed, all made her very heart numb, as if it were held within the chill
      embrace of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the woman moves, speaks or screams, gag her at once!” said Collot
      roughly the moment she sat down, and Sergeant Hebert stood over her, gag
      and cloth in hand, whilst two soldiers placed heavy hands on her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she neither moved nor spoke, not even presently when a loud and
      cheerful voice came echoing from a distant corridor, and anon the door
      opened and her husband came in, accompanied by Chauvelin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-ambassador was very obviously in a state of acute nervous tension;
      his hands were tightly clasped behind his back, and his movements were
      curiously irresponsible and jerky. But Sir Percy Blakeney looked a picture
      of calm unconcern: the lace bow at his throat was tied with scrupulous
      care, his eyeglass upheld at quite the correct angle, and his
      delicate-coloured caped coat was thrown back just sufficiently to afford a
      glimpse of the dainty cloth suit and exquisitely embroidered waistcoat
      beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the perfect presentation of a London dandy, and might have been
      entering a royal drawing-room in company with an honoured guest.
      Marguerite's eyes were riveted on him as he came well within the circle of
      light projected by the candles, but not even with that acute sixth sense
      of a passionate and loving woman could she detect the slightest tremor in
      the aristocratic hands which held the gold-rimmed eyeglass, nor the
      faintest quiver of the firmly moulded lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had occurred just as the bell of the old Beffroi chimed
      three-quarters after six. Now it was close on seven, and in the centre of
      the room and with his face and figure well lighted up by the candles, at
      the table pen in hand sat Sir Percy writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his elbow just behind him stood Chauvelin on the one side and Collot
      d'Herbois on the other, both watching with fixed and burning eyes the
      writing of that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy seemed in no hurry. He wrote slowly and deliberately, carefully
      copying the draft of the letter which was propped up in front of him. The
      spelling of some of the French words seemed to have troubled him at first,
      for when he began he made many facetious and self-deprecatory remarks
      anent his own want of education, and carelessness in youth in acquiring
      the gentle art of speaking so elegant a language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, he appeared more at his ease, or perhaps less inclined
      to talk, since he only received curt monosyllabic answers to his pleasant
      sallies. Five minutes had gone by without any other sound, save the
      spasmodic creak of Sir Percy's pen upon the paper, the while Chauvelin and
      Collot watched every word he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gradually from afar there had arisen in the stillness of evening a
      distant, rolling noise like that of surf breaking against the cliffs.
      Nearer and louder it grew, and as it increased in volume, so it gained now
      in diversity. The monotonous, roll-like, far-off thunder was just as
      continuous as before, but now shriller notes broke out from amongst the
      more remote sounds, a loud laugh seemed ever and anon to pierce the
      distance and to rise above the persistent hubbub, which became the mere
      accompaniment to these isolated tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merrymakers of Boulogne, having started from the Place de la
      Senechaussee, were making the round of the town by the wide avenue which
      tops the ramparts. They were coming past the Fort Gayole, shouting,
      singing, brass trumpets in front, big drum ahead, drenched, hot, and
      hoarse, but supremely happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy looked up for a moment as the noise drew nearer, then turned to
      Chauvelin and pointing to the letter, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have nearly finished!”
     </p>
    <p>
      The suspense in the smoke-laden atmosphere of this room was becoming
      unendurable, and four hearts at least were beating wildly with
      overpowering anxiety. Marguerite's eyes were fixed with tender intensity
      on the man she so passionately loved. She did not understand his actions
      or his motives, but she felt a wild longing in her, to drink in every line
      of that loved face, as if with this last, long look she was bidding an
      eternal farewell to all hopes of future earthly happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old priest had ceased to tell his beads. Feeling in his kindly heart
      the echo of the appalling tragedy which was being enacted before him, he
      had put out a fatherly, tentative hand towards Marguerite, and given her
      icy fingers a comforting pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the hearts of Chauvelin and his colleague there was satisfied
      revenge, eager, exultant triumph and that terrible nerve-tension which
      immediately precedes the long-expected climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who can say what went on within the heart of that bold adventurer,
      about to be brought to the lowest depths of humiliation which it is in the
      power of man to endure? What behind that smooth unruffled brow still bent
      laboriously over the page of writing?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was now on the Place Daumont; some of the foremost in the ranks
      were ascending the stone steps which lead to the southern ramparts. The
      noise had become incessant: Pierrots and Pierrettes, Harlequins and
      Columbines had worked themselves up into a veritable intoxication of
      shouts and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as they all swarmed up the steps and caught sight of the open window
      almost on a level with the ground, and of the large dimly-lighted room,
      they gave forth one terrific and voluminous “Hurrah!” for the paternal
      government up in Paris, who had given them cause for all this joy. Then
      they recollected how the amnesty, the pardon, the national fete, this
      brilliant procession had come about, and somebody in the crowd shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Allons! les us have a look at that English spy!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Let us see the Scarlet Pimpernel!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Yes! yes! let us see what he is like!”
     </p>
    <p>
      They shouted and stamped and swarmed round the open window, swinging their
      lanthorns and demanding in a loud tone of voice that the English spy be
      shown to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faces wet with rain and perspiration tried to peep in at the window.
      Collot gave brief orders to the soldiers to close the shutters at once and
      to push away the crowd, but the crowd would not be pushed. It would not be
      gainsaid, and when the soldiers tried to close the window, twenty angry
      fists broke the panes of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can't finish this writing in your lingo, sir, whilst this demmed row is
      going on,” said Sir Percy placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have not much more to write, Sir Percy,” urged Chauvelin with nervous
      impatience, “I pray you, finish the matter now, and get you gone from out
      this city.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Send that demmed lot away, then,” rejoined Sir Percy calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They won't go.... They want to see you...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Percy paused a moment, pen in hand, as if in deep reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They want to see me,” he said with a laugh. “Why, demn it all... then,
      why not let em?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a few rapid strokes of the pen, he quickly finished the letter,
      adding his signature with a bold flourish, whilst the crowd, pushing,
      jostling, shouting and cursing the soldiers, still loudly demanded to see
      the Scarlet Pimpernel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin felt as if his heart would veritably burst with the wildness of
      its beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sir Percy, with one hand lightly pressed on the letter, pushed his
      chair away and with his pleasant ringing voice, said once again:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well! demn it... let 'em see me!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he sprang to his feet and up to his full height, and as he did
      so he seized the two massive pewter candlesticks, one in each hand, and
      with powerful arms well outstretched he held them high above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The letter...” murmured Chauvelin in a hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as he was quickly reaching out a hand, which shook with the
      intensity of his excitement, towards the letter on the table, Blakeney,
      with one loud and sudden shout, threw the heavy candlesticks onto the
      floor. They rattled down with a terrific crash, the lights were
      extinguished, and the whole room was immediately plunged in utter
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd gave a wild yell of fear: they had only caught sight for one
      instant of that gigantic figure—which, with arms outstretched had
      seemed supernaturally tall—weirdly illumined by the flickering light
      of the tallow candles and the next moment disappearing into utter darkness
      before their very gaze. Overcome with sudden superstitious fear, Pierrots
      and Pierrettes, drummer and trumpeters turned and fled in every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the room all was wild confusion. The soldiers had heard a cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      “La fenetre! La fenetre!”
     </p>
    <p>
      Who gave it no one knew, no one could afterwards recollect: certain it is
      that with one accord the majority of the men made a rush for the open
      window, driven thither partly by the wild instinct of the chase after an
      escaping enemy, and partly by the same superstitious terror which had
      caused the crowd to flee. They clambered over the sill and dropped down on
      to the ramparts below, then started in wild pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the crash came, Chauvelin had given one frantic shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The letter!!!... Collot!!... A moi.... In his hand.... The letter!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a heavy thud, of a terrible scuffle there on the
      floor in the darkness and then a yell of victory from Collot d'Herbois.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have the letter! A Paris!”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Victory!” echoed Chauvelin, exultant and panting, “victory!! The Angelus,
      friend Hebert! Take the calotin to ring the Angelus!!!”
     </p>
    <p>
      It was instinct which caused Collot d'Herbois to find the door; he tore it
      open, letting in a feeble ray of light from the corridor. He stood in the
      doorway one moment, his slouchy, ungainly form distinctly outlined against
      the lighter background beyond, a look of exultant and malicious triumph,
      of deadly hate and cruelty distinctly imprinted on his face and with
      upraised hand wildly flourishing the precious document, the brand of
      dishonour for the enemy of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A Paris!” shouted Chauvelin to him excitedly. “Into Robespierre's hands.
      ... The letter!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he fell back panting, exhausted on the nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collot, without looking again behind him, called wildly for the men who
      were to escort him to Paris. They were picked troopers, stalwart veterans
      from the old municipal guard. They had not broken their ranks throughout
      the turmoil, and fell into line in perfect order as they followed Citizen
      Collot out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less than five minutes later there was the noise of stamping and champing
      of bits in the courtyard below, a shout from Collot, and the sound of a
      cavalcade galloping at break-neck speed towards the distant Paris gate.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIV: The Angelus
    </h2>
    <p>
      And gradually all noises died away around the old Fort Gayole. The shouts
      and laugher of the merrymakers, who had quickly recovered from their
      fright, now came only as the muffled rumble of a distant storm, broken
      here and there by the shrill note of a girl's loud laughter, or a vigorous
      fanfare from the brass trumpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room where so much turmoil had taken place, where so many hearts had
      beaten with torrent-like emotions, where the awesome tragedy of revenge
      and hate, of love and passion had been consummated, was now silent and at
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers had gone: some in pursuit of the revellers, some with Collot
      d'Herbois, others with Hebert and the calotin who was to ring the Angelus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin, overcome with the intensity of his exultation and the agony of
      the suspense which he had endured, sat, vaguely dreaming, hardly
      conscious, but wholly happy and content. Fearless, too, for his triumph
      was complete, and he cared not now if he lived or died.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lived long enough to see the complete annihilation and dishonour of
      his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened to Sir Percy Blakeney now, what to Marguerite, he
      neither knew nor cared. No doubt the Englishman had picked himself up and
      got away through the window or the door: he would be anxious to get his
      wife out of the town as quickly as possible. The Angelus would ring
      directly, the gates would be opened, the harbour made free to everyone....
    </p>
    <p>
      And Collot was a league outside Boulogne by now... a league nearer to
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what mattered the humbled wayside English flower?—the damaged and
      withered Scarlet Pimpernel?...
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight noise suddenly caused him to start. He had been dreaming, no
      doubt, having fallen into some kind of torpor, akin to sleep, after the
      deadly and restless fatigue of the past four days. He certainly had been
      unconscious of everything around him, of time and of place. But now he
      felt fully awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again he heard that slight noise, as if something or someone was
      moving in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to peer into the darkness, but could distinguish nothing. He rose
      and went to the door. It was still open, and close behind it against the
      wall a small oil lamp was fixed which lit up the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin detached the lamp and came back with it into the room. Just as
      he did so there came to his ears the first sound of the little church bell
      ringing the Angelus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the room holding the lamp high above his head; its feeble
      rays fell full upon the brilliant figure of Sir Percy Blakeney.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was smiling pleasantly, bowing slightly towards Chauvelin, and in his
      hand he held the sheathed sword, the blade of which had been fashioned in
      Toledo for Lorenzo Cenci, and the fellow of which was lying now—Chauvelin
      himself knew not where.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The day and hour, Monsieur, I think,” said Sir Percy with courtly grace,
      “when you and I are to cross swords together; those are the southern
      ramparts, meseems. Will you precede, sir? and I will follow.”
     </p>
    <p>
      At sight of this man, of his impudence and of his daring, Chauvelin felt
      an icy grip on his heart. His cheeks became ashen white, his thin lips
      closed with a snap, and the hand which held the lamp aloft trembled
      visibly. Sir Percy stood before him, still smiling and with a graceful
      gesture pointing towards the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Church of St. Joseph the gentle, melancholy tones of the Angelus
      sounding the second Ave Maria came faintly echoing in the evening air.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a violent effort Chauvelin forced himself to self-control, and tried
      to shake off the strange feeling of obsession which had overwhelmed him in
      the presence of this extraordinary man. He walked quite quietly up to the
      table and placed the lamp upon it. As in a flash recollection had come
      back to him.. the past few minutes!... the letter! and Collot well on his
      way to Paris!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bah! he had nothing to fear now, save perhaps death at the hand of this
      adventurer turned assassin in his misery and humiliation!
    </p>
    <p>
      “A truce on this folly, Sir Percy,” he said roughly, “as you well know, I
      had never any intention of fighting you with these poisoned swords of
      yours and...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “I knew that, M. Chauvelin.... But do YOU know that I have the intention
      of killing you now... as you stand... like a dog!...”
     </p>
    <p>
      And throwing down the sword with one of those uncontrolled outbursts of
      almost animal passion, which for one instant revealed the real, inner man,
      he went up to Chauvelin and towering above him like a great avenging
      giant, he savoured for one second the joy of looking down on that puny,
      slender figure which he could crush with sheer brute force, with one blow
      from his powerful hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Chauvelin at this moment was beyond fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And if you killed me now, Sir Percy,” he said quietly and looking the man
      whom he so hated fully in the eyes, “you could not destroy that letter
      which my colleague is taking to Paris at this very moment.”
     </p>
    <p>
      As he had anticipated, his words seemed to change Sir Percy's mood in an
      instant. The passion in the handsome, aristocratic face faded in a trice,
      the hard lines round the jaw and lips relaxed, the fire of revenge died
      out from the lazy blue eyes, and the next moment a long, loud, merry laugh
      raised the dormant echoes of the old fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Monsieur Chaubertin,” said Sir Percy gaily, “but this is
      marvellous... demmed marvellous... do you hear that, m'dear?... Gadzooks!
      but 'tis the best joke I have heard this past twelve-months.... Monsieur
      here thinks... Lud! but I shall die of laughing.... Monsieur here
      thinks... that 'twas that demmed letter which went to Paris... and that an
      English gentleman lay scuffling on the floor and allowed a letter to be
      filched from him...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Sir Percy!...” gasped Chauvelin, as an awful thought seemed suddenly to
      flash across his fevered brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lud, sir, you are astonishing!” said Sir Percy, taking a very much
      crumpled sheet of paper from the capacious pocket of his elegant caped
      coat, and holding it close to Chauvelin's horror-stricken gaze. “THIS is
      the letter which I wrote at that table yonder in order to gain time and in
      order to fool you.... But, by the Lord, you are a bigger demmed fool than
      ever I took you to be, if you thought it would serve any other purpose
      save that of my hitting you in the face with it.”
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a quick and violent gesture he struck Chauvelin full in the face
      with the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You would like to know, Monsieur Chaubertin, would you not?...” he added
      pleasantly, “what letter it is that your friend, Citizen Collot, is taking
      in such hot haste to Paris for you.... Well! the letter is not long and
      'tis written in verse.... I wrote it myself upstairs to-day whilst you
      thought me sodden with brandy and three-parts asleep. But brandy is easily
      flung out of the window.... Did you think I drank it all?... Nay! as you
      remember, I told you that I was not so drunk as you thought?... Aye! the
      letter is writ in English verse, Monsieur, and it reads thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      “We seek him here! we seek him there! Those Frenchies seek him everywhere!
      Is he in heaven? is he in hell? That demmed elusive Pimpernel?
    </p>
    <p>
      “A neat rhyme, I fancy, Monsieur, and one which will, if rightly
      translated, greatly please your friend and ruler, Citizen Robespierre....
      Your colleague Citizen Collot is well on his way to Paris with it by now.
      ... No, no, Monsieur... as you rightly said just now... I really could not
      kill you... God having blessed me with the saving sense of humour...”
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke the third Ave Maria of the Angelus died away on the
      morning air. From the harbour and the old Chateau there came the loud boom of
      cannon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of the opening of the gates, of the general amnesty and free
      harbour was announced throughout Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chauvelin was livid with rage, fear and baffled revenge. He made a sudden
      rush for the door in a blind desire to call for help, but Sir Percy had
      toyed long enough with his prey. The hour was speeding on: Hebert and some
      of the soldiers might return, and it was time to think of safety and of
      flight. Quick as a hunted panther, he had interposed his tall figure
      between his enemy and the latter's chance of calling for aid, then,
      seizing the little man by the shoulders, he pushed him back into that
      portion of the room where Marguerite and the Abbe Foucquet had been lately
      sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gag, with cloth and cord, which had been intended for a woman were
      lying on the ground close by, just where Hebert had dropped them, when he
      marched the old Abbe off to the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      With quick and dexterous hands, Sir Percy soon reduced Chauvelin to an
      impotent and silent bundle. The ex-ambassador after four days of harrowing
      nerve-tension, followed by so awful a climax, was weakened physically and
      mentally, whilst Blakeney, powerful, athletic and always absolutely
      unperturbed, was fresh in body and spirit. He had slept calmly all the
      afternoon, having quietly thought out all his plans, left nothing to
      chance, and acted methodically and quickly, and invariably with perfect
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having fully assured himself that the cords were well fastened, the gag
      secure and Chauvelin completely helpless, he took the now inert mass up in
      his arms and carried it into the adjoining room, where Marguerite for
      twelve hours had endured a terrible martyrdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his enemy's helpless form upon the couch, and for one moment
      looked down on it with a strange feeling of pity quite unmixed with
      contempt. The light from the lamp in the further room struck vaguely upon
      the prostrate figure of Chauvelin. He seemed to have lost consciousness,
      for the eyes were closed, only the hands, which were tied securely to his
      body, had a spasmodic, nervous twitch in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a good-natured shrug of the shoulders the imperturbable Sir Percy
      turned to go, but just before he did so, he took a scrap of paper from his
      waistcoat pocket, and slipped it between Chauvelin's trembling fingers. On
      the paper were scribbled the four lines of verse which in the next four
      and twenty hours Robespierre himself and his colleagues would read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Blakeney finally went out of the room.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Chapter XXXV: Marguerite
    </h2>
    <p>
      As he re-entered the large room, she was standing beside the table, with
      one dainty hand resting against the back of the chair, her whole graceful
      figure bent forward as if in an agony of ardent expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never for an instant, in that supreme moment when his precious life was at
      stake, did she waver in courage or presence of mind. From the moment that
      he jumped up and took the candlesticks in his hands, her sixth sense
      showed her as in a flash what he meant to do and how he would wish her to
      act.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the room was plunged in darkness she stood absolutely still; when she
      heard the scuffle on the floor she never trembled, for her passionate
      heart had already told her that he never meant to deliver that infamous
      letter into his enemies' hands. Then, when there was the general scramble,
      when the soldiers rushed away, when the room became empty and Chauvelin
      alone remained, she shrank quietly into the darkest corner of the room,
      hardly breathing, only waiting.... Waiting for a sign from him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not see him, but she felt the beloved presence there, somewhere
      close to her, and she knew that he would wish her to wait.... She watched
      him silently... ready to help if he called... equally ready to remain
      still and to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when the helpless body of her deadly enemy was well out of the way
      did she come from out the darkness, and now she stood with the full light
      of the lamp illumining her ruddy golden hair, the delicate blush on her
      cheek, the flame of love dancing in her glorious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he saw her as he re-entered the room, and for one second he paused at
      the door, for the joy of seeing her there seemed greater than he could
      bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten was the agony of mind which he had endured, the humiliations and
      the dangers which still threatened: he only remembered that she loved him
      and that he worshipped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment she lay clasped in his arms. All was still around them,
      save for the gentle patter-patter of the rain on the trees of the
      ramparts: and from very far away the echo of laughter and music from the
      distant revellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the cry of the sea-mew thrice repeated from just beneath the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blakeney and Marguerite awoke from their brief dream: once more the
      passionate lover gave place to the man of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      “'Tis Tony, an I mistake not,” he said hurriedly, as with loving fingers
      still slightly trembling with suppressed passion, he readjusted the hood
      over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord Tony?” she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! with Hastings and one or two others. I told them to be ready for us
      to-night as soon as the place was quiet.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “You were so sure of success then, Percy?” she asked in wonderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “So sure,” he replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he led her to the window, and lifted her onto the sill. It was not
      high from the ground and two pairs of willing arms were there ready to
      help her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he, too, followed, and quietly the little party turned to walk toward
      the gate. The ramparts themselves now looked strangely still and silent:
      the merrymakers were far away, only one or two passers-by hurried swiftly
      past here and there, carrying bundles, evidently bent on making use of
      that welcome permission to leave this dangerous soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little party walked on in silence, Marguerite's small hand resting on
      her husband's arm. Anon they came upon a group of soldiers who were
      standing somewhat perfunctorily and irresolutely close by the open gate of
      the Fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tiens c'est l'Anglais!” said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Morbleu! he is on his way back to England,” commented another lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates of Boulogne had been thrown open to everyone when the Angelus
      was rung and the cannon boomed. The general amnesty had been proclaimed,
      everyone had the right to come and go as they pleased, the sentinels had
      been ordered to challenge no one and to let everyone pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew that the great and glorious plans for the complete
      annihilation of the Scarlet Pimpernel and his League had come to naught,
      that Collot was taking a mighty hoax to Paris, and that the man who had
      thought out and nearly carried through the most fiendishly cruel plan ever
      conceived for the destruction of an enemy, lay helpless, bound and gagged,
      within his own stronghold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the little party, consisting of Sir Percy and Marguerite, Lord
      Anthony Dewhurst and my Lord Hastings, passed unchallenged through the
      gates of Boulogne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the precincts of the town they met my Lord Everingham and Sir
      Philip Glynde, who had met the Abbe Foucquet outside his little church and
      escorted him safely out of the city, whilst Francois and Felicite with
      their old mother had been under the charge of other members of the League.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We were all in the procession, dressed up in all sorts of ragged finery,
      until the last moment,” explained Lord Tony to Marguerite as the entire
      party now quickly made its way to the harbour. “We did not know what was
      going to happen.... All we knew was that we should be wanted about this
      time—the hour when the duel was to have been fought—and
      somewhere near here on the southern ramparts... and we always have strict
      orders to mix with the crowd if there happens to be one. When we saw
      Blakeney raise the candlesticks we guessed what was coming, and we each
      went to our respective posts. It was all quite simple.”
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man spoke gaily and lightly, but through the easy banter of his
      tone, there pierced the enthusiasm and pride of the soldier in the glory
      and daring of his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the city walls and the harbour there was much bustle and
      agitation. The English packet-boat would lift anchor at the turn of the
      tide, and as every one was free to get aboard without leave or passport,
      there were a very large number of passengers, bound for the land of
      freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two boats from the “Day-Dream” were waiting in readiness for Sir Percy and
      my lady and those whom they would bring with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently the party embarked, and as the boats pushed off and the sailors
      from Sir Percy's yacht bent to their oars, the old Abbe Foucquet began
      gently droning a Pater and Ave to the accompaniment of his beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted joy, happiness and safety with the same gentle philosophy as
      he would have accepted death, but Marguerite's keen and loving ears caught
      at the end of each “Pater” a gently murmured request to le bon Dieu to
      bless and protect our English rescuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only once did Marguerite make allusion to that terrible time which had
      become the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were wandering together down the chestnut alley in the beautiful
      garden at Richmond. It was evening, and the air was heavy with the rich
      odour of wet earth, of belated roses and dying mignonette. She had paused
      in the alley, and placed a trembling hand upon his arm, whilst raising her
      eyes filled with tears of tender passion up to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Percy!” she murmured, “have you forgiven me?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “What, m'dear?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “That awful evening in Boulogne... what that fiend demanded... his awful
      'either—or'... I brought it all upon you... it was all my fault.”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, my dear, for that 'tis I should thank you...”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Thank me?”
     </p>
    <p>
      “Aye,” he said, whilst in the fast-gathering dusk she could only just
      perceive the sudden hardening of his face, the look of wild passion in his
      eyes, “but for that evening in Boulogne, but for that alternative which
      that devil placed before me, I might never have known how much you meant
      to me.”
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the recollection of all the sorrow, the anxiety, the torturing
      humiliations of that night seemed completely to change him; the voice
      became trenchant, the hands were tightly clenched. But Marguerite drew
      nearer to him; her two hands were on his breast; she murmured gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now?...”
     </p>
    <p>
      He folded her in his arms, with an agony of joy, and said earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now I know.”
     </p>
